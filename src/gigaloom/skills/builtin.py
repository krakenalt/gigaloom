## Required core

- `SKILL.md` frontmatter contains only `name` and `description`.
- The name is lowercase, hyphenated, and at most 64 characters.
- The description states both capability and triggering context.
- Instructions are imperative, concise, and self-contained.

## Optional resources

- `scripts/` contains deterministic executable helpers.
- `references/` contains material loaded only when needed.
- `assets/` contains output resources, not hidden instructions.

## Delivery boundary

Provider metadata stays in target overlays. A valid candidate still requires an immutable package, compatibility probe, transactional preview, explicit approval, verification, and reversible installation.
