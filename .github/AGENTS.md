# AGENTS.md — GitHub automation

## Scope

These rules apply to `.github/**` in addition to the root instructions.
Workflow files are executable release and security configuration: preserve
their behavior deliberately and verify claims against the YAML itself.

## Invariants

- Keep the CI Python matrix aligned with the Harness `requires-python`
  declaration. Required checks must keep Python 3.11, 3.13, and 3.14 Harness
  tests, Ruff, frontend, base artifact, terminal, performance, and browser QA
  independently visible.
- No quality job may rely on a gateway source tree, editable sibling, project
  lock, real provider, native user home, or mutable external service.
- Keep public registry/all-extras readiness bound to the committed target lock.
  The exact gateway extra must resolve from the public registry without a
  candidate URL, temporary index, sibling checkout, or source override.
- Keep release publication restricted to the exact protected environment and
  target policy. The candidate workflow may build and attest but must not
  publish. The protected publish workflow may only consume an exact retained
  candidate after registry-state verification. Trusted Publisher registration
  remains an external PyPI owner-acceptance gate.
- Minimize `permissions:`; never expose secrets to untrusted pull-request code
  or print secret values.
- Keep action versions explicit. Review third-party actions and permission
  changes as supply-chain-sensitive code.

## Coupled changes

- Keep `ci.yaml`, `nightly-smoke.yaml`, `scripts/ci-*.sh`, and their stable
  check and artifact names aligned.
- Keep `publish-pypi.yml`, `release-publish.yml`, `release-policy.json`,
  `repository-policy.json`, `RELEASE_RECOVERY.md`, `scripts/release_guard.py`,
  and `scripts/release_registry_guard.py` aligned.
- Keep `docs-pages.yaml`, `docs-site/package-lock.json`, and Docusaurus
  commands aligned.
- Keep English and Russian PR/issue templates structurally aligned.
- When workspace paths or package boundaries change, audit every workflow path
  filter, build command, cache key, and artifact assertion.

## Validation

- Run the exact local commands represented by a changed workflow when feasible.
- Run `actionlint` if it is installed; otherwise inspect the complete workflow
  diff and rely on repository contract tests plus GitHub validation.
- For packaging changes, run the full Harness quality gate, the standalone
  `--no-sources` build, and the relevant package-isolation tests.
- For docs workflow changes, run `npm --prefix docs-site run build`.
