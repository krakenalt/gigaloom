# Owner and recovery acceptance checklist

This checklist is a specification, not evidence that an external action has
already happened. Record only non-secret evidence. Keep recovery codes,
personal contact details, tokens, and private advisory content outside the
repository.

## GitHub backup and repository protection

- [ ] A human account distinct from `@krakenalt` has accepted the named
      `backup-github-maintainer` role.
- [ ] The backup account has 2FA enabled and can reach repository settings and
      private vulnerability reports.
- [ ] Default workflow token permission is read-only and Actions cannot approve
      pull requests.
- [ ] `protect-main` and `protect-gigaloom-release-tags` match
      `.github/repository-policy.json`.
- [ ] Required checks exactly match the successful job names emitted by
      `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
- [ ] Main and protected release tags reject deletion and force-push; the
      main ruleset has no bypass, while any protected-tag release or emergency
      bypass produces an audit event.
- [ ] Secret scanning and push protection are enabled without copying any
      source-organization secret.
- [ ] The primary and backup owners can open the private reporting channel and
      identify the first containment steps in `SECURITY.md`.

## PyPI backup and publisher handoff

- [ ] PyPI shows the exact accepted service username for Ruslan Yakupov in the
      named `primary-pypi-owner` role; no GitHub-to-PyPI username inference is
      used.
- [ ] A human account distinct from the primary owner has accepted the named
      `backup-pypi-owner` role for `gigaloom`.
- [ ] The backup PyPI owner has 2FA enabled.
- [ ] The pending Trusted Publisher names PyPI project `gigaloom` and binds
      only `krakenalt/gigaloom`, the exact publish workflow, and the protected
      release environment.
- [ ] Manual dispatch of the candidate workflow cannot publish.
- [ ] The source workflow is incapable of publishing before the target
      publisher is used.
- [ ] Both owners can freeze or remove a compromised publisher and can explain
      why an existing PyPI version must never be overwritten.

## Recovery drill

- [ ] The backup GitHub maintainer can freeze releases, preserve protected refs
      and workflow evidence, and prepare a reviewed corrective commit.
- [ ] The backup PyPI owner can compare public files with retained hashes, yank
      an unsafe version when authorized, and leave immutable evidence intact.
- [ ] A primary-owner-unavailable drill stops safely if either backup role is
      not accepted.
- [ ] Issue and pull-request continuation uses source links and does not claim
      transferred comments, authorship, timestamps, approvals, or review state.
- [ ] The drill records date, actor handles, repository/package role shown by
      the service, 2FA confirmation, exact policy commit, and result without
      storing secrets.

Public push remains blocked until repository authority is approved. Repository
protection and GitHub backup acceptance remain blocked until the GitHub backup
accepts access. Publisher mutation, PyPI backup acceptance, tags, releases, and
publication remain blocked until the PyPI backup accepts ownership.
