# Unified Harness

:::warning[Alpha preview — prerelease]

The `gpt2giga-harness` 0.4.x line is an alpha preview for testing and feedback.
The UI, CLI, project YAML, runtime schema, and upgrade behavior can change while
the product is being developed. Use it for local evaluation and supervised
workflows, not as a production-critical or unattended multi-user service.

:::

Unified Harness is a local project cockpit on top of `gpt2giga`. It gives you
one place to run a task through direct GigaChat, Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini
CLI, or a plugin harness; compare the results; inspect what happened; and decide
which changes are allowed back into your project.

The product name shown by the Web UI, TUI, and human-facing CLI output is
**GigaLoom**. The `giga` command and `gpt2giga-harness` distribution names stay
unchanged for compatibility.

### Visual identity and icon policy

The GigaLoom loom mark is original project artwork and is not copied from or
derived from GigaChat branding. Its canonical source is
`packages/gpt2giga-harness/branding/gigaloom-mark.svg`; the repository license
governs that source. Run
`node packages/gpt2giga-harness/branding/generate-assets.mjs` to reproduce its
light, dark, mask, favicon, manifest, packaged-UI, and documentation variants.

Skills, Plugins, and MCP use curated local pictograms. Unknown integrations use
a deterministic text monogram. GigaLoom does not fetch remote icons, so catalog
rendering does not grant an external origin network, tracking, SVG, or content
authority.

The Harness is not another model and it does not replace the compatibility
gateway or the agent CLIs. It coordinates them and keeps a normalized local
record of runs, approvals, artifacts, and reusable project automation.

## Why use it

Working with several agent CLIs usually means different commands, histories,
permission models, and output formats. Unified Harness adds a common layer for:

- **one project cockpit** — start from the current repository with `giga ui`;
- **repeatable runs** — save agents, prompts, evals, workflows, and schedules
  under `.giga/` instead of rebuilding the setup for every task;
- **comparison** — send the same task to several available harnesses in Arena
  and inspect the results side by side;
- **review before mutation** — keep edit runs in isolated Git worktrees and put
  apply/branch actions behind explicit approvals;
- **traceability** — inspect durable run status, attempts, redacted events,
  artifacts, diffs, and provenance after the browser or UI server restarts;
- **local control** — keep project configuration and runtime history on your
  machine rather than introducing a hosted control plane.

### Mental model

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `gpt2giga` gateway | Exposes OpenAI-, Anthropic-, and Gemini-shaped HTTP APIs backed by GigaChat. |
| Unified Harness | Selects a harness and model, coordinates runs, stores local history, and exposes the CLI/UI. |
| Direct Chat or agent CLI | Performs the actual model or agent work. External CLIs remain responsible for behavior inside their own process. |

This separation matters: an approval shown by Unified Harness covers actions it
owns, such as spawning a run or applying a captured patch. It cannot claim to
observe every internal action performed by a black-box external CLI.

## Native CLI prefix contract

The native compatibility rule is literal: add exactly `giga` before the
provider command. Harness does not invent one shared execution grammar.

```sh
giga codex exec --json "inspect this repository"
giga claude -p "inspect this repository"
giga gemini -p "inspect this repository"
```

After the provider token, argv is opaque. Provider-scoped `--help` and
`--version`, stdin, stdout/stderr placement, raw bytes, JSON/JSONL, `--`,
signals, and exit status stay native. Unknown commands and flags therefore keep
working without waiting for a Harness parser update.

| Situation | Example | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Human TTY | `giga codex` | Admitted Workbench L2, or a visible provider-owned L1 handoff on drift. |
| Pipe/stdin | `printf 'task' \| giga claude -p -` | Native L0 descriptors and bytes. |
| Redirect | `giga gemini -p task >result.txt` | Provider stdout is written directly. |
| JSON | `giga codex exec --json task` | Provider JSON/JSONL remains unchanged. |
| CI | `CI=1 giga gemini -p task` | Prompt-free native L0 execution. |
| Resume | `giga codex resume --last` | Exact provider selector; admitted L2 or visible L1. |
| Structured drift | version outside the reviewed window | Only L2 degrades; valid L0 commands remain available. |
| Missing runtime | `giga claude --version` without Claude | Actionable startup failure before provider side effects. |

Inspect the local truth with `giga doctor --json`. Each native provider entry
reports the executable and source, version evidence, L0/L1/L2 state, structured
transport, fallback, degradation reason, and remediation. The report is
content-free and does not retain provider argv, prompts, or output.

### Shell completion

Generate completion for the stable Harness boundary and source it according to
your shell's normal startup conventions:

```sh
giga completion bash
giga completion zsh
giga completion fish
giga completion powershell
```

The scripts intentionally do not mirror upstream provider parsers. Once
`codex`, `claude`, or `gemini` is selected, the suffix and `--` remain untouched
and the shell's default completion applies.

### Install, migrate, and roll back

The standard wheel/sdist contains the TUI and native facade but no provider
binary, Node.js runtime, credentials, or provider configuration. Both `uv tool`
and `pipx` create an isolated Harness environment:

```sh
uv tool install 'gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1'
pipx install 'gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1'
```

Upgrade an existing optional-TUI prerelease in place; do not retain or add a
`[tui]` extra. Before an upgrade, back up user-owned Harness state. Rollback is
an exact package reinstall plus restoration of a verified pre-upgrade state
archive when a state migration occurred:

```sh
giga state backup /safe/path/harness-before-upgrade.zip
uv tool install --force 'gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1'
uv tool install --force 'gpt2giga-harness==<previous-version>'
uv tool uninstall gpt2giga-harness
uv tool install 'gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1'
```

Uninstalling the package does not delete `~/.gpt2giga/harness`, project
`.giga/`, or native provider homes. Harness never reverse-migrates provider
configuration or installs/authenticates a provider runtime.

## Is the prerelease preview for you?

Try it now if you want to evaluate a local agent cockpit, compare harnesses,
prototype reviewable workflows, or give feedback while the interfaces are
still being shaped. Start with `echo`, dry-runs, `plan`/`read` modes, and a test
repository before allowing edits.

Wait for a later release if you need a stable automation API, guaranteed
backward compatibility, high availability, central multi-user administration,
or a security boundary around arbitrary behavior inside third-party CLIs.

During the prerelease:

- read release notes before upgrading and back up `~/.gpt2giga/harness` plus
  important project `.giga/` definitions;
- expect optional features to depend on the exact Codex, Claude, or Gemini CLI
  installed on the workstation;
- keep the UI on its default loopback address unless you deliberately configure
  remote authentication and TLS;
- review generated `.giga/` files before committing them, and never put secrets
  in project configuration;
- report bugs with `giga doctor`, the Harness version, reproduction steps, and
  redacted diagnostics in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ai-forever/gpt2giga/issues).

## Quickstart

### 1. Get the preview and check the workstation

The source checkout is the current, always-available preview path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-forever/gpt2giga.git
cd gpt2giga
uv sync --all-packages --all-extras --dev
source .venv/bin/activate
giga doctor
giga --version
giga harness list
```

Keep the checkout virtual environment activated in every terminal used for the
preview. You can then `cd` to the project you want to inspect while `giga` and
`gpt2giga` continue to resolve from the checkout. On Windows, activate
`.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` instead.

If the standalone preview is available in your package index, the shorter
install path is:

```bash
uv tool install 'gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1'
giga doctor
```

For Direct Chat and the `gpt2giga` provider preset, install the explicit extra:

```bash
uv tool install 'gpt2giga-harness[gpt2giga]==0.5.0a1'
```

The current `gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1` distribution provides the `giga` and
`gpt2giga-harness` commands; its explicit `gpt2giga` extra pins
`gpt2giga==0.2.5a1`.

Requirements are Python 3.10–3.14 and `uv`. Direct GigaChat runs also need the
gateway credentials described in the [gpt2giga quickstart](quickstart.md).
Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini integrations require the matching external CLI
executable on `PATH` (or an explicit executable override) plus a configured
local gateway. The proxy-backed execution paths do not require a separate
vendor login; the distinct Claude provider-owned handoff does. Unavailable CLIs
stay disabled rather than breaking the cockpit.

#### Base install and optional providers

The provider-neutral base distribution has nine reviewed direct runtime
dependencies. Release CI installs the Harness wheel on Python 3.10–3.14 across
Linux, macOS, and Windows, runs terminal-command smoke, and runs a versioned
audit that fails if the resolved environment exceeds 64 distributions or
includes packages from these optional integration families:

- the `gpt2giga`/GigaChat provider preset;
- Office document readers and writers;
- remote messaging channels;
- external client or agent UI frameworks;
- sandbox and container providers.

Add those capabilities through the explicit `gpt2giga` extra, a separately
installed provider distribution, or a Harness entry-point plugin. The base
package does not install or silently enable them. The Codex, Claude Code, and
Gemini adapters remain built in, but
their separately managed CLI executables are discovered on `PATH` rather than
installed as Python dependencies.

For release or package debugging, run this only inside a clean base-install
environment; an environment with an intentionally installed optional provider
is expected to fail the base-only audit:

```bash
python -I -m gpt2giga_harness.base_install --json
```

The source-checkout `uv sync --all-packages --all-extras --dev` command installs
development tooling and repository integration fixtures, so it is not a base
footprint measurement.

#### Terminal TUI and automation cutover

The standard install includes the canonical terminal workbench. Bare `giga` and
the compatibility alias `giga tui` open it on a supported interactive terminal.
Human `giga chat`, `giga run --agent`, and `giga session list|show|create|turn`
deep-link into the same TUI while preserving the explicit workspace, session,
Harness, model, mode, transport, and prompt intent.

Use the non-interactive CLI for scripts and administration. `--non-interactive`,
`--json`, `--dry-run`, redirected streams, pipes, CI, help/version, admin
commands, and session event/approval inspection do not initialize Textual,
prompt, or emit terminal-control sequences. `giga open ...` remains an explicit
external handoff. An explicitly requested TUI fails before import under
`TERM=dumb` or an unsupported terminal; a redirected human command keeps its
established CLI schema, bytes, exit code, and stdout/stderr discipline.

To migrate from the optional-TUI prerelease, upgrade the standard package and
remove `[tui]` from install commands:

```bash
uv tool install --force 'gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1'
giga --version
giga
```

Rollback installs the exact previously reviewed version with `uv tool install
--force 'gpt2giga-harness==<previous-version>'`. `uv tool uninstall
gpt2giga-harness` removes the package and commands but does not delete the
user-owned Harness runtime data.

### 2. Initialize a disposable or test project

Run the first tour in a repository where generated project files and test edits
are safe to inspect:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
giga doctor .
giga doctor . --json
giga init
```

`giga doctor [workspace]` gives the first-run readiness verdict before any
agent is spawned. Its structured `--json` form covers proxy and route health,
model discovery, external CLI versions, workspace and Git readiness, the
durable worker, Harness-managed homes, and managed MCP snapshots. Checks are
classified as `ready`, `degraded`, or `blocked`; degraded and blocked
prerequisites include a remediation command. The report redacts secret values,
does not publish an absolute workspace path, and reads existing runtime worker
state without rewriting it. It also carries a stable report kind plus exact
Harness/gateway, Python, and platform metadata; external CLI compatibility is
embedded from the same bounded capability probes used for execution.

Schema v2 adds the UI identity boundary, scoped network contract, GitHub CLI,
and separate MCP, Skills, and Plugins source-health checks. The report declares
its privacy contract, bounds the check count, carries a canonical SHA-256, and
lists every disabled action with one exact recovery step. **Settings →
Diagnostics → Run first-run doctor** uses the same contract in offline mode:
it does not contact provider/model routes, GitHub, skills.sh, or an IdP. The
downloaded JSON contains counts, hashes, statuses, and recovery commands, but no
prompts, secrets, OAuth material, raw traffic, raw paths, or private file
content. Use the CLI doctor only when live proxy and route probes are intended.

For CI, choose the failure threshold explicitly. `blocked` returns exit code 1
only for blocked checks; `degraded` returns 1 for either degraded or blocked
checks. Without `--fail-on`, doctor keeps its interactive exit-code-0 behavior.
For an issue report, `--output` atomically writes the same canonical,
redaction-safe JSON with mode `0600` while stdout keeps the selected human or
JSON format:

```bash
giga doctor . --json --fail-on blocked
giga doctor . --json --output harness-doctor.json
```

`giga init` creates non-secret starter configuration, agent profiles, prompts,
an eval, and a review workflow under `.giga/`. Existing files are not replaced
unless you pass `--overwrite`.

Before connecting a real model, verify the local execution path with the
credential-free `echo` harness:

```bash
giga harness run echo \
  --workspace . \
  --prompt "Summarize the selected task"
```

For a complete disposable tour, use the
[first-run demo repository](https://github.com/ai-forever/gpt2giga/tree/main/examples/harness/first-run-demo).
It contains only fictional inventory inputs. The walkthrough copies them to a
temporary Git repository, isolates Harness runtime state under that copy, runs
`giga init` and `giga doctor .`, then verifies a read-only Echo run and the two
generated smoke-eval cases. It needs no credentials, proxy, external agent CLI,
or public-network access.

The model-backed
[issue-to-reviewed-patch example](https://github.com/ai-forever/gpt2giga/tree/main/examples/harness/issue-to-reviewed-patch)
packages three reviewed agent profiles, a durable workflow that retains edits
in a Harness-owned worktree, and a post-apply eval. Its walkthrough keeps the
source checkout unchanged before approval and leaves apply, commit, push, and
hosted writes as explicit operator decisions.

The model-backed
[nightly compatibility guardian](https://github.com/ai-forever/gpt2giga/tree/main/examples/harness/nightly-compatibility-guardian)
packages a pinned Codex/Claude/Gemini eval, exact baseline dimensions, a
read-only triage workflow, and a durable nightly schedule. It runs while the UI
is closed and moves only a failed, previously tested schedule contract into
Attention for product/adapter/model/environment classification.

The model-backed
[cross-harness review team](https://github.com/ai-forever/gpt2giga/tree/main/examples/harness/cross-harness-review-team)
fans out read-only explorer, security, tests, and maintainability roles across
Codex, Claude, and Gemini. One synthesis step cites retained child artifacts;
a failed child remains visible and the workflow cannot silently report partial
evidence as success.

Preview an external agent command without launching it:

```bash
giga run \
  --agent codex \
  --mode read \
  --workspace . \
  --dry-run \
  "Summarize this repository"
```

### 3. Connect GigaChat

For browser and durable-worker runs, keep the gateway running in a separate
terminal. Activate the same source-checkout environment in that terminal, then
run:

```bash
source /path/to/gpt2giga/.venv/bin/activate
gpt2giga
```

With tool installations, install/expose the gateway command separately as
described in the [gpt2giga quickstart](quickstart.md), then run `gpt2giga`.

In another terminal, inspect the harness environment:

```bash
giga doctor
giga harness list
```

If the proxy is not running, `giga chat`, `giga harness run direct-chat`, and
real external agent CLI runs try to start a local sidecar by default. Disable
that for a single command with:

```bash
giga chat --no-start-proxy --api-mode v2 --model GigaChat-2-Max "Привет"
```

Run direct Chat Completions smoke tests through explicit backend routes:

```bash
giga chat --api-mode v2 --model GigaChat-2-Max "Привет"
giga chat --api-mode v1 --model GigaChat-2-Max "Привет"
```

The same flow through the generic harness command:

```bash
giga harness run direct-chat \
  --api-mode v2 \
  --model GigaChat-2-Max \
  --prompt "Hello from the harness"
```

### 4. Open the project cockpit

Open the local UI:

```bash
giga ui
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8091/`. A useful first tour is:

1. Confirm the current project and selected session in **Workbench**.
2. Select `echo` and submit a harmless prompt.
3. Open **Runs** and inspect the attempt, trace, and stored redacted payloads.
4. Open **Evaluation → Arena** to compare available harnesses on one task.
5. Inspect **Approvals**, **Attention**, **Automation**, **Evaluation**, and
   **Integrations** before enabling edits or unattended execution.

Cockpit V2 is the only packaged local UI. Saved links from the previous UI
redirect to their canonical Cockpit destinations without migrating or
rewriting Harness runtime state. If packaged Cockpit assets are unavailable,
reinstall the Harness package or restore its verified build artifact.

For a retained assistant response, **Copy** fetches and copies the full text
even when the feed shows only a bounded preview. For structured and one-shot
runs, the pencil appears only on the latest user message. Editing and
resubmitting it replaces that active chat turn and removes its following
assistant response from the conversation; the superseded run remains available
in Runs as append-only audit evidence. Native terminal sessions do not expose
the pencil because a retained interactive process cannot be rewound safely.

`giga ui` starts a local durable worker automatically when no online worker is
registered. Use `giga ui --no-start-worker` when a separately supervised worker
already exists or when the UI should only inspect durable state.

The standalone worker owns durable structured and one-shot UI runs, leases,
heartbeats, timeouts, retries, and cancellation, so a run survives a browser or
UI-server restart.
Arena children and Eval case/harness pairs use the same independent durable
jobs and update their transparent parent JSON records as attempts finish.
Use `giga worker status` to inspect registered workers, or run a temporary
worker with `giga worker stop-on-idle --idle-seconds 30`. Workers deliberately
do not auto-start a proxy: start `gpt2giga` yourself and configure
`GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_API_KEY` when a harness needs the proxy. This avoids treating
the UI process's temporary sidecar key cache as durable worker state.

An empty worker now backs off from 250 ms to a bounded 1 second idle wait.
Queue, approval, and schedule-configuration changes send a content-free
loopback wake signal, while schedule, retry, and lease deadlines cap the wait
even if wake delivery is unavailable. `--poll-seconds` changes the minimum and
`--max-idle-seconds` changes the cap. This does not increase worker concurrency
or change lease, cancellation, recovery, or durable ownership semantics.

The `Runs` area is the durable queue and history view. It filters queued,
running, blocked, approval-needed, failed, canceled, and completed jobs; shows
attempt count, retries, duration, selected metrics, and worker ownership; and
reconnects to active SSE streams after a browser or UI-server restart. Opening
a run loads a bounded hierarchical trace first. Individual redacted event
payloads and artifacts are fetched only when inspected, and model reasoning is
never exposed by the trace API or rendered in the timeline. Safe retry is
available only when the latest failed attempt declares a read-only,
deterministic, or otherwise retry-safe idempotency class.

The lightweight Runs Center API is cursor-paginated:

```text
GET  /api/runs?status=running&limit=25&cursor=...
GET  /api/runs/{run_id}/summary
GET  /api/runs/{run_id}/trace?limit=100&cursor=...
GET  /api/runs/{run_id}/events/{event_id}
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/retry
```

The `Approvals` area is the policy inbox for actions owned by Unified Harness.
The shared taxonomy covers workspace reads/writes, process and network access,
MCP server/tool actions, git apply/branch, external writes, and schedule
operations. Each decision records whether enforcement is owned by the Harness,
delegated to a CLI sandbox, or advisory/unobservable. The UI never claims that
it can inspect arbitrary actions inside black-box Codex, Claude, or Gemini
subprocesses.

Interactive runs use the `interactive` profile by default. Select
`review every action` in Advanced settings to persist a pre-spawn approval and
put the durable job in `waiting_approval` without creating an attempt, process,
or lease. An approval requeues the same logical job; denial cancels it. Apply
and branch actions always require an approval before mutating the source
checkout. Allow-once grants are consumed, run grants stay scoped to one run,
and project grants require an expiry.

```text
GET  /api/policy/profiles
GET  /api/approvals?status=pending
POST /api/approvals/{approval_id}/decision
```

### Scheduled jobs

Project schedules are shareable YAML definitions under
`.giga/schedules/<schedule_id>.yaml`; mutable enablement, next-run state, and
occurrence history stay in `runtime.sqlite3`. A schedule captures an immutable,
redacted content hash and snapshot of its agent, preset, workflow, or eval
target. Editing any material field pauses the schedule and invalidates its
previous `Test now` grant.

One-shot, fixed interval, and RRULE cadence are supported with an explicit IANA
timezone. Occurrences are stored as UTC instants. Nonexistent spring-forward
times are recorded as misfires, and ambiguous fall-back times run once at the
first instant. The default overlap and misfire policies both skip rather than
silently catch up or run concurrent copies.

The local worker evaluates due schedules before claiming ordinary jobs, so an
open browser is not required. Enable is blocked until the exact schedule hash
passes backend `Test now` and a live worker is registered. Scheduled edits use
the unattended policy profile and fail closed unless an isolated Git worktree
can be created; `schedule.unattended_edit` remains approval-gated. Resume mode
serializes work per session and stores its explicit history cutoff.

```bash
giga schedule preview schedule.yaml --workspace /path/to/project --json
giga schedule create schedule.yaml --workspace /path/to/project --json
giga schedule list --workspace /path/to/project --json
giga schedule test-now daily-review --workspace /path/to/project --json
giga schedule enable daily-review --workspace /path/to/project --json
giga schedule run-now daily-review --workspace /path/to/project --json
giga schedule pause daily-review --workspace /path/to/project --json
```

The authenticated API exposes matching CRUD, preview, test, enable/pause,
resume, and run-now operations under `/api/schedules`. Create/update, enable,
and run-now use the shared Approval Center policy actions. Deleting a schedule
archives its SQLite audit state instead of erasing occurrence history. The
top-level `Scheduled` area adds list, upcoming-calendar, and immutable-history
views plus a typed wizard for target, cadence, destination, worktree isolation,
concurrency, retry/misfire policy, and notifications. It explains the exact-hash
`Test now` gate and worker-online requirement before enable.

The schedule wizard follows the Codex Scheduled mental model for common cases:
choose **Once**, **Daily**, **Weekdays**, or **Weekly**, then set the first run,
IANA timezone, target, prompt, and notification preference. Harness compiles
those choices into the governed one-shot, fixed-interval, or RRULE contract.
Use **Custom** and the collapsed **Advanced · JSON** editor only when an
explicit RRULE or a lower-level policy field is required.

The same area contains the project Attention Inbox. Pending approvals, failed
durable jobs, and schedules in `needs_attention` are derived from their source
audit records rather than copied into a second queue. Marking an item read only
stores acknowledgement state in `runtime.sqlite3`; it never deletes the job,
approval, schedule snapshot, or occurrence history. Desktop notifications are
optional, browser-session-only, and link back to the relevant approval, run, or
schedule. A schedule must opt in to schedule-finding notifications explicitly.

```text
GET  /api/automation?workspace=/path/to/project
GET  /api/attention?workspace=/path/to/project
POST /api/attention/read
```

The top-level `Tools` area is the MCP connection center. It shows redacted
project descriptors, transport and trust state, per-harness compatibility,
latest health, discovered server instructions, tools/resources/prompts, input
and output schemas, risk labels, and bounded probe history. It does not execute
tools or write harness config.

From a project directory, inspect or initialize the project cockpit config:

```bash
giga project info
giga project init
# Short alias:
giga init
```

By default the UI binds to `127.0.0.1:8091`. The first OS-local browser claim
creates an opaque, expiring HttpOnly, `SameSite=Strict` session backed only by
hashed private state under the Harness data directory. Cockpit Settings can
rotate or log out that browser session; the loopback-only recovery page revokes
older sessions before claiming a new one. Browser mutations also require the
same-origin CSRF marker. No local access token is placed in a URL,
`localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, diagnostics, screenshots, or project files.

Remote binding implements the bounded G3-04 single-issuer OIDC/BFF identity
contract. A non-loopback listener requires the complete static issuer, client,
public HTTPS origin, exact subject-to-role map, and explicit `--allow-remote`.
Authorization Code + PKCE `S256`, nonce/signature/audience validation, opaque
server-side sessions, exact-origin CSRF, `viewer`/`operator` enforcement,
JWKS rotation, and session/actor/global/back-channel revocation fail closed.
The old bootstrap token and Host allowlist never authenticate remote users.

See the [remote UI identity ADR](architecture/remote-ui-identity-adr.md) for the
accepted role, session, CSRF, revocation, trusted-proxy, and recovery contract.
Do not expose or tunnel the loopback listener as a multi-user workaround.

## Configuration

CLI flags override environment variables. Useful variables:

```bash
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_PROXY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_API_KEY=<local-proxy-api-key>
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DEFAULT_MODEL=GigaChat-2-Max
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DEFAULT_API_MODE=v2
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_UI_HOST=127.0.0.1
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_UI_PORT=8091
# Remote deployment only; keep the secret in deployment-owned secret storage:
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_UI_OIDC_ISSUER=https://issuer.example
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_UI_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=gigaloom
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_UI_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<deployment-secret>
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_UI_OIDC_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=https://harness.example
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_UI_OIDC_ROLE_MAP='{"subject-1":"viewer","subject-2":"operator"}'
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_UI_TRUSTED_PROXIES=10.0.0.2
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_AUTO_START_PROXY=True
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_PROXY_START_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=15
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=3600
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR=~/.gpt2giga/harness
```

Cockpit Settings exposes separate defaults for chat requests and generated
session titles. Use **Discover models** and select both values from the models
reported by the active API route. The choices are stored in
`settings/defaults.json` under the Harness data directory and apply to new
runs; when the title model is cleared, title generation uses the selected chat
model. `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DEFAULT_MODEL` or `GIGACHAT_MODEL` continues to lock
the chat default when it is environment-owned.

If `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_API_KEY` is not set, the harness falls back to
`GPT2GIGA_API_KEY` for calls to the local proxy. It never passes
`GIGACHAT_CREDENTIALS`, OAuth tokens, certificates, or `.env` contents to
external agent CLIs.

Auto-start is local-only. It supports `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`,
`http://localhost:<port>`, and `http://[::1]:<port>`. It refuses remote hosts,
does not create fake upstream credentials, and starts the child proxy with a
generated local `GPT2GIGA_API_KEY` if one is not already configured.

External agent harnesses run the same proxy preflight before launching Codex,
Claude Code, or Gemini CLI. If a sidecar is started, the generated local proxy
key is passed only through the agent-specific local API-key environment variable
and remains redacted from JSON/UI results.

### Provider and Route Profiles

Cockpit **Settings → Provider** and **Routes & models** manage backend-owned
profiles for OpenAI-, Anthropic-, and Gemini-compatible endpoints. A provider
owns its protocol dialect, base URL, route prefix, authentication ownership,
enabled/offline state, and purpose-specific model defaults. New runs freeze the
selected provider and route into their execution snapshot, so later settings
changes do not rewrite retained evidence or an active structured session.

Credentials are references, never form values. Settings and the CLI accept an
environment-variable or keychain reference and return only its kind and name;
the secret value is resolved only at the owning request or subprocess boundary.
Literal credentials, credential files, and unrestricted filesystem paths are
rejected by the provider settings service.

For example, register an OpenAI Responses-compatible endpoint whose key remains
in `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

```bash
giga provider add openai-production \
  --name "OpenAI production" \
  --protocol openai_compatible \

giga provider show openai-production --json
giga provider test openai-production --json
giga provider discover openai-production --json
```

`test` and `discover` are explicit bounded operations. A missing probe backend,
authentication failure, or incompatible endpoint is reported as content-free
health evidence and does not silently select another provider. Edit requires
the current `revision` from `show` or Settings, which prevents an older browser
or CLI request from overwriting a newer configuration:

```bash
giga provider edit openai-production \
  --expected-revision <revision> \
  --coding-model <new-model-id> \
  --json
```

Legacy proxy/API-mode/model defaults remain readable during the prerelease
transition. Migrate them only through the forward-only, backup-gated flow:

```bash
giga provider migrate-legacy --dry-run --json
giga provider migrate-legacy \
  --backup /safe/path/harness-before-provider-migration.zip \
  --json
```

The migration revalidates source and target state under a lock before publishing
the provider registry and journal. There is no reverse migration: stop Harness
and restore the verified pre-upgrade archive if rollback is required.

### Project Config

`giga project init` creates a non-secret `.giga/harness.toml` in the current
project root. If the command runs inside a git repository, the git top-level
directory is used as the project root; otherwise the current directory is used.

The config stores project defaults such as harness, model, explicit `v1`/`v2`
API mode, mode, enabled harnesses, presets, and future attachment safety
defaults. It must not contain API keys, tokens, cookies, credentials, private
keys, certificates, or `.env` contents.

Project init also creates safe prompt templates under `.giga/prompts/` and a
local smoke eval under `.giga/evals/smoke.yaml`.
Presets can render inline `prompt` text or a relative `prompt_file` inside the
project root. Supported template variables are:

- `{{project_name}}`
- `{{branch}}`
- `{{selected_files}}`
- `{{selected_files_inline}}`
- `{{last_run_diff}}`
- `{{user_prompt}}`

The same variables can also be written as `${project_name}` or `$project_name`.
Preset files are never allowed to point outside the project root.

`giga ui` also keeps mutable, non-secret cockpit state per project under the
harness data directory. This includes the last selected harness, model, API
mode, run mode, invocation mode, and selected session. It is intentionally local
state, not repository config.

Use JSON output when wiring tools or checking what `giga ui` will use:

```bash
giga project info --json
giga project init --name my-project --json
giga preset list --json
giga preset run fix_tests --prompt "focus on tests/harness" --dry-run --json
```

In the browser cockpit, preset chips fill the composer with the rendered prompt
and preset defaults. They do not execute automatically; use `Run` or `Compare`
after reviewing the filled request.

### Reusable Agent Profiles

Project agents are reusable role/configuration profiles over existing harnesses.
They live in `.giga/agents/*.yaml`; `giga init` creates Planner, Explorer,
Implementer, Reviewer, Test Runner, and Release Assistant starters. Profiles can
bind instructions, harness/model/reasoning effort/route, context and memory
selectors, MCP tool descriptor ids, fixed allow/deny tool selectors,
permission/workspace policy, budgets, and an expected artifact. They never
contain literal secrets, arbitrary CLI flags, or paths that escape the project.

```bash
giga agent list --workspace .
giga agent show reviewer --workspace . --json
giga agent validate .giga/agents/reviewer.yaml
giga agent run reviewer --workspace . --prompt "Review this patch" --dry-run
```

The first-class `/agents` Agent Studio lists and validates profiles, previews a
redacted diff, checks the source SHA-256 ETag, and performs an explicit atomic
Apply. Duplicate creates a draft until Apply is selected. The same reusable
project authoring service is intended for later Workflow Builder and Schedule
Wizard surfaces; those features must not write project YAML directly.

`Run as Agent` submits a normal durable manual job. Agent Studio resolves every
operational field into an `effective`, `delegated`, or `unsupported` execution
outcome before queueing. The API and each run store the immutable redacted
`agent_profile_snapshot`, `agent_execution_plan`, requested/effective values,
enforcement source, and `agent_id`, so later YAML edits do not rewrite history.
Unsupported safety or budget options block queueing; provenance-only selectors
produce explicit warnings. Live activity remains in Work and Runs rather than
being duplicated in Agent Studio.

Current adapter option contract (structured admission can narrow it further):

| Profile option | Codex CLI | Claude Code | Gemini CLI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| model, route, mode, workspace/permission policy | effective | effective | effective |
| timeout and retry attempts | Harness-enforced | Harness-enforced | Harness-enforced |
| `reasoning_effort` | capability-proven config | capability-proven `--effort` | unsupported |
| `allowed_tools` / `disallowed_tools` | unsupported | capability-proven fixed flags | unsupported |
| `tool_ids` | immutable managed-MCP snapshot | immutable managed-MCP snapshot | immutable managed-MCP snapshot |
| `max_tokens` | unsupported | unsupported | unsupported |

`max_concurrency: 1` describes a standalone agent run; larger fan-out belongs
to a Workflow or Schedule coordinator. Selected `tool_ids` must name enabled,
trusted, adapter-compatible project MCP profiles. They are frozen before
queueing and materialized only into the active temporary execution home. A
structured driver can reject an option whose projection is not yet proven; for
example, Gemini ACP currently rejects managed MCP projection instead of falling
back to the one-shot path. Prompt files, skills, and context/memory selectors
remain visible as unsupported provenance. Tool selectors are values for fixed
adapter flags and can never inject additional flags.

Authenticated APIs:

- `GET /api/agents` and `GET /api/agents/{agent_id}`;
- `POST /api/agents/validate`;
- `POST /api/agents/{agent_id}/draft` and `/apply`;
- `POST /api/agents/{agent_id}/duplicate` and `/run`.

### Versioned Workflows

Project workflows are bounded DAG definitions under `.giga/workflows/*.yaml`.
`giga init` installs a read-only `review-team` starter that plans, fans out to
security/test-gap/maintainability reviews, and synthesizes their results. Every
run stores the exact SHA-256 definition hash plus immutable workflow and step
snapshots, so later YAML edits cannot rewrite execution history.

The version 1 IR supports `agent`, `arena`, `eval`, explicit `approval`, safe
built-in `transform`, and `join` steps. Definitions may set dependencies,
`on_success`/`on_failure`/`always` conditions, bounded concurrency and fan-out,
retries, timeouts, typed input maps, output names, and artifact references.
Cycles, unknown dependencies, arbitrary transform code, more than 64 steps, or
fan-out above 16 fail validation. Arbitrary shell nodes are intentionally not
part of the workflow IR.

```bash
giga workflow list --workspace .
giga workflow show review-team --workspace . --json
giga workflow validate .giga/workflows/review-team.yaml
giga workflow run review-team --workspace . --prompt "Review this change" --dry-run
giga workflow run review-team --workspace . --prompt "Review this change" --json
giga workflow status <workflow_run_id> --json
giga workflow cancel <workflow_run_id>
```

Agent, arena, and eval work is submitted through the same durable job worker as
manual Runs. Workflow cancellation persists first and propagates to every
active child job. Explicit approval steps enter `waiting_approval` and reuse the
Approval Center; no process or lease is created for the approval node itself.
Safe transform/join nodes run locally without arbitrary code execution.

The built-in Review Team is the first collaborative workflow rather than an
Arena alias. Planner output is summarized and handed to three parallel
reviewers; their summaries and selected artifact references are then handed to
the Synthesizer. Handoffs are redacted and bounded to 8,000 characters and 16
artifact references per dependency. Each child job retains its immutable agent
profile snapshot, including its harness, model, reasoning effort, tools,
permission profile, and budgets.

Editing agents are always forced into a distinct detached Git worktree,
regardless of a weaker policy in their profile. Worktree preparation fails
closed and never falls back to the source checkout. Completed, failed, and
interrupted worktrees remain available for review until explicitly discarded.
Their visible output is projected into a strict handoff vocabulary: `plan`,
`selected_files`, `patch`, `diff`, `test_report`, `review_findings`, and
`pr_draft`. Read-only reviewers can receive bounded patch/test previews without
write access or private reasoning.

Patch selection is explicit. The runtime detects file-level overlap, refuses
conflicting merge queues, and prepares non-overlapping combinations in another
retained worktree. Choosing, reviewing/applying, and discarding remain user
actions; applying a combined queue requires an auditable `git.apply` approval.
The harness never auto-applies or auto-pushes team output.

Work exposes the selected run's team in the `Team` inspector tab. Runs exposes
the same live parent/child tree with step status, active work, concurrency,
model/budget metadata, artifact counts, and deep links to the shared task or an
individual child run. The workflow-level concurrency cap continues to govern
fan-out, and cancel propagates through the same durable job runtime.

Authenticated APIs:

- `GET /api/workflows` and `GET /api/workflows/{workflow_id}`;
- `POST /api/workflows/validate` and
  `POST /api/workflows/{workflow_id}/run`;
- `GET /api/workflow-runs/{run_id}` and
  `POST /api/workflow-runs/{run_id}/cancel`;
- `GET /api/workflow-runs/{run_id}/handoffs`, plus explicit per-step `choose`
  and `discard` actions;
- `POST /api/workflow-runs/{run_id}/merge-queue` and approval-gated
  `/merge-queue/apply`.

The top-level **Workflows** area is a catalog and form/step builder over this
same execution IR. It shows a dependency-level DAG preview and per-definition
run history, supports atomic optimistic-lock saves, and archives the previous
YAML under `.giga/workflows/.history/<workflow_id>/`. Typed form edits merge
into the exact YAML source, preserving unknown top-level and per-step fields so
a newer definition is not silently damaged by an older UI.

Catalog actions include duplicate, YAML import/export, and three starter
templates: Plan-Implement-Test-Review, Diagnose-Fix-Regression, and
Issue-Patch-PR Draft. Free-form drag-and-drop graph editing remains deferred;
step ordering and dependencies stay explicit and validated.

Automation also provides one connected, zero-setup example in every empty
section:

1. **Code Reviewer** — a read-only Codex agent profile.
2. **Review Change** — a workflow that invokes `code-reviewer`.
3. **Weekday Review** — a weekday schedule that targets `review-change`.

Open **Automation → Agents**, create and apply Code Reviewer, then repeat in
**Workflows**. Run either definition from its detail view. Finally create the
schedule, use **Test** to bind the exact content hash, and choose **Enable** only
when a worker is online. The cards also show the equivalent
`giga run --agent`, `giga workflow`, and `giga schedule` commands for CLI users.

Additional catalog APIs:

- `POST /api/workflows/import`;
- `PUT /api/workflows/{workflow_id}` with `expected_hash` and an optional typed
  form merge;
- `POST /api/workflows/{workflow_id}/duplicate`;
- `GET /api/workflows/{workflow_id}/export`.

### Project Memory

Project memory stores explicit, user-approved project facts and decisions under
the harness data directory:

```text
projects/<project_id>/memory.jsonl
```

Only enabled entries are injected into future session runs for the same project.
The injected entries are also recorded in `run.metadata.project_memory` and the
redacted raw request, so each run shows exactly which memory was included.
Disabled entries remain visible for review but are not sent to harnesses.

Manage memory from the CLI:

```bash
giga memory list --workspace . --json
giga memory add "Use Alembic migrations" --workspace . --tag decision
giga memory disable <memory_id> --workspace .
giga memory enable <memory_id> --workspace .
giga memory delete <memory_id> --workspace .
```

The browser cockpit exposes the same workflow in the `Memory` inspector tab,
including adding entries, editing text, enabling/disabling, deleting, and
promoting the latest chat message to memory.

The matching API surface is:

```text
GET    /api/project/memory
POST   /api/project/memory
PATCH  /api/project/memory/{memory_id}
DELETE /api/project/memory/{memory_id}
```

Memory text, tags, and metadata pass through the same secret-looking value
redaction used by sessions and raw records before storage or API/UI output.

### Run Preflight

Session-backed runs pass through a local pre-run safety check before a harness is
invoked. The report scans prompt text, enabled project memory, previous chat
messages, and selected attachments for private-key material, token-looking
values, credential assignments, `.env`-style files, deny-listed paths,
git-ignored workspace files, and large attachments.

The same report now contains a machine-readable `readiness` projection for the
selected execution plan: harness availability, invocation mode, exact API
route/model, required workspace/Git policy, managed state, and synchronous or
durable delivery. Only relevant checks are selected. A missing proxy or agent
CLI cannot block Echo, while a missing selected executable or Git repository
required for an isolated edit blocks before process or worktree creation. Every
non-ready check carries a redaction-safe remediation message and command shared
with `giga doctor`.

Hard-block findings stop the run before `HarnessRun`, messages, raw requests,
or external CLI processes are written. Warning findings are saved in
`run.metadata.preflight`, included in the redacted raw request, and emitted as a
warning event when a run continues. The browser UI calls the same check through:

```text
POST /api/preflight/run
```

The response includes `hard_block`, the selected-plan `readiness` report, a list
of content findings with safe remediation actions, and a context budget estimate
covering prompt length, enabled memory, attached files, image count/size,
previous chat turns, and truncation warnings.
For attachment findings, the UI can remove the file from the current composer
selection or send only an `@path` reference. `Continue anyway` is shown only for
warning-level findings, not hard blocks.

### Reviewed bootstrap and execution assurance

`giga bootstrap` provides an auditable first-run path without merging discovery
and mutation. Preview runs doctor read-only and returns a deterministic
`plan_id`; apply accepts only that current plan and explicitly selected
reversible steps:

```bash
giga bootstrap preview --workspace . --json
giga bootstrap apply <plan_id> --workspace . --all-reversible --json
giga bootstrap status <application_id> --json
giga bootstrap rollback <application_id> --workspace . --json
```

The application journal records only bounded identities and paths created by
Harness. Rollback removes an item only while it still matches that journal and
fails closed if the workspace, data root, or generated content has changed.
Bootstrap never installs providers, resolves credentials, starts external
processes, or enables schedules.

Run the side-effect-free compatibility guardian before a model-backed matrix:

```bash
giga compatibility check --json
giga compatibility check --harness codex-cli --json
```

The guardian checks the reviewed Codex, Claude, and Gemini CLI windows, native
protocol admissions, Adapter and Integration SDK/schema versions, and
marketplace source contracts. It does not start providers or integrations and
returns exit code 1 when a required fixture is blocked. Cockpit uses the same
read-only report from `GET /api/compatibility/guardian`.

Each run preflight also projects a content-free permission simulation for the
exact Harness, provider route, execution transport, workspace policy, and
extension snapshot. Filesystem, command, network, secret, integration,
provider, and Git/GitHub actions are classified as allowed,
approval-required, denied, or unknown and as pre-start, runtime-dependent, or
provider-owned. A denied required action blocks startup; runtime-dependent and
provider-owned actions are never presented as guaranteed grants.

Harness-owned outbound HTTPS is default-deny and uses the
[scoped network access contract](architecture/scoped-network-access-adr.md).
An exact, unexpired grant and an enabled sandbox boundary are both required;
host, port, method class, redirect policy, purpose, request digest, and transfer
ceilings are revalidated before connection. Public DNS answers are pinned and
the connected peer must match. The optional reviewed proxy policy is
loopback-only and allowlist-first, with purpose-bound expiring rules and no
global wildcard. This policy does not activate provider or integration traffic
by itself.

Runs Center can create a Trace-to-Replay comparison that changes exactly one
model, provider, Harness, or extensions axis. Preview hashes the retained source
evidence and every unchanged dimension. Starting the reviewed manifest creates
a new session, uses the existing execution authority, and never applies a patch
automatically. The retained comparison reports normalized outcome, usage, tool,
artifact, environment, and evidence deltas without requiring external
telemetry.

For a transfer without target execution, create a truthful handoff capsule:

```bash
giga handoff capsule <run_id> --target-harness <harness_id> --json
```

The capsule is a verifiable content-free snapshot of the task and evidence
identities, Git environment, pending approvals, target compatibility, and
continuity limits. It neither starts the target nor claims that provider-owned
history can be resumed. Runs Center and
`GET /api/runs/{run_id}/handoff-capsule` expose the same contract.

### Tool Profiles

Projects can define non-secret tool profiles in `.giga/harness.toml`:

```toml
[tools.github]
enabled = true
title = "GitHub"
kind = "mcp"
description = "Project issue and PR tools"
harnesses = ["codex-cli", "claude-code", "gemini-cli"]

[tools.github.config]
readonly = true
```

The legacy profile APIs remain available as a side-effect-free compatibility
preview:

```text
GET  /api/tools
POST /api/tools/sync
```

The Tools area can also preview, apply, and roll back trusted MCP connections in
Harness-owned Codex, Claude, and Gemini homes:

```text
POST /api/tool-config/preview
POST /api/tool-config/apply
POST /api/tool-config/rollback
```

Preview returns the exact redacted diff and a current-content hash. Apply
requires that hash, takes a per-home lock, writes atomically, records an
ownership marker and content hash, and keeps the previous content as a backup.
Rollback succeeds only while the ownership marker and hash still match. Config
changes are rejected while a managed native process owns the home. User-owned
`~/.codex`, Claude, and Gemini settings are never changed.

Only enabled, trusted servers are composed. Native-home preview/apply never
copies secret references into persistent CLI config. For process-backed
AgentProfile runs, selected `tool_ids` instead create an immutable
descriptor-free public snapshot reference plus a content-verified internal
snapshot under the Harness data directory. Replay reuses the same snapshot even
if project TOML changes. A structured driver must separately prove its MCP
projection; unsupported combinations fail before execution. The adapter
resolves allowed secret references only while constructing the subprocess
config, writes the exact reviewed entries into its temporary active home, and
exposes only descriptor-free snapshot identity in run provenance.
Temp-home contents disappear after the process; user-owned homes remain
unchanged. No package installation or OAuth occurs.

MCP profiles can additionally describe a stdio or Streamable HTTP connection:

```toml
[tools.issues]
enabled = true
title = "Issue MCP"
kind = "mcp"
harnesses = ["codex-cli", "claude-code"]
transport = "stdio"
command = "issue-mcp"
args = ["--readonly"]
timeout_seconds = 10
trusted = false

[tools.issues.env.ISSUE_TOKEN.secret_ref]
kind = "environment"
name = "ISSUE_MCP_TOKEN"

[tools.search]
enabled = true
kind = "mcp"
transport = "streamable_http"
url = "https://mcp.example.test/rpc"

[tools.search.headers.Authorization.secret_ref]
kind = "environment"
name = "SEARCH_MCP_AUTHORIZATION"

[tools.search.risk_policy]
low = "allow"
medium = "ask"
high = "deny"
```

Environment and headers accept literal non-secret values or an explicit
`secret_ref`. Sensitive authentication headers reject literal values. URLs are
restricted to HTTP(S) without embedded userinfo; probe responses are bounded to
1 MB and timeouts must be positive. Stdio probes receive a minimal
environment plus explicitly resolved profile values rather than the complete
parent environment. Discovery negotiates the MCP `2025-11-25` protocol,
includes the negotiated version on subsequent HTTP requests, and refuses HTTP
redirects so authentication headers cannot cross to another origin.

An MCP probe performs only `initialize`, `tools/list`, `resources/list`, and
`prompts/list`. Starting an untrusted stdio server or connecting to a new HTTP
origin creates a project-scoped Approval Center request. After approval, retry
the probe. Results are appended as redacted JSONL under
`GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR/tools/probe_history.jsonl`:

```text
GET  /api/tool-servers?workspace=...
GET  /api/tool-servers/{server_id}?workspace=...
POST /api/tool-servers/{server_id}/probe
```

MCP tool invocation remains disabled. External CLI MCP usage is labeled
`delegated_to_cli_sandbox` and opaque unless a structured adapter emits explicit
call/result events. Agent run snapshots record the bound server ids and this
enforcement boundary as configuration provenance.

### Federated Skills and MCP installation

The Cockpit **Plugins** area can filter **Built-in** packages from **External
Skills & MCP** discovered through the offline catalog. The `skills-sh` source
contributes hosted Skill metadata through the separately deployed read-only
proxy, while `neuraldeep` contributes public Skill and MCP metadata. Source
popularity, curation, health, or presence is discovery evidence only: it never
grants installation authority, enables network access, or replaces an exact
artifact review.

The **Skills**, **Plugins**, and **MCP** pages each expose their matching
**Add** action. Search queries read NeuralDeep directly. To include
`skills.sh`, run the metadata proxy and pass its fixed origin to the Harness UI:

```bash
export VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN=<request-scoped-token>
giga-skills-catalog-proxy

# in the Harness process
export GIGA_SKILLS_PROXY_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:8092
giga ui
```

The Skills page contains the same setup guide next to the source filter. A
healthy proxy changes the source from `configuration_required` or `unavailable`
to `ready`; a retained last-good result remains visibly marked `stale`.

For production, deploy the proxy on Vercel with OIDC Federation enabled and use
the request-scoped `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`; do not bake a token into an image,
configuration file, or static environment export. The
[skills.sh API contract](https://www.skills.sh/docs/api) rotates the token,
returns `401` for missing or expired authentication, and returns `429` with
`Retry-After` when rate-limited. `/healthz` reports `configuration_required`
until OIDC is available. Configure the bounded in-memory last-good cache with
`GIGA_SKILLS_PROXY_CACHE_ENTRIES` and
`GIGA_SKILLS_PROXY_STALE_IF_ERROR_SECONDS`. Retained responses are explicitly
marked `X-Giga-Cache-Status: stale`, expose their `Age`, and never conceal the
source error.

The fixed-origin proxy supports leaderboard/search, curated results, bounded
detail file paths, and optional audit metadata. It strips file contents and
audit summaries before returning data to Harness. Cockpit shows the canonical
source, upstream ID, repository URL, immutable hash, relative path, discovery
breadcrumb, last sync, cache age, last-good state, and bounded audit verdicts.
The same URL/origin/ref/hash projection is included in exact install previews
and retained flow receipts.

**Add Skill** accepts a public GitHub repository or `/tree/<ref>` URL, pins the
resolved commit, lists bounded `SKILL.md` candidates, previews the selected
instructions, normalizes portable frontmatter, and installs only after the
exact preview is approved. **Add Plugin** uses the same immutable inspection
but requires a reviewed `integration-package.json` for a compatible native
Plugin/Extension target. **Add MCP** accepts an exact stdio or HTTP descriptor
and can install it into Codex, Claude, Gemini, or the Harness-managed inventory.

Existing shared Skills are also visible and filterable by Harness. By default,
Harness scans `~/.agents/skills` as shared root Skills and the native Codex,
Claude, and Gemini Skill homes. Set `GIGA_ROOT_SKILLS_DIRS` to an
OS-path-separated list when the shared roots live elsewhere. Inventory reads
metadata only; full `SKILL.md` content is loaded for the bounded preview after
an item is selected.

Harness also scans the system bundles already shipped by OpenAI under the
`openai-primary-runtime` and `openai-bundled` plugin caches. Capabilities such
as PDF, Documents, Presentations, and Spreadsheets therefore appear under
**Plugins** with an **OpenAI** source badge, their bundled Skill names, default
prompts, and an `@name` invocation hint. This inventory is read-only: Harness
does not install, enable, or rewrite an OpenAI bundle.

In **Work**, type `@` to select one of these capabilities. For a Codex CLI run,
Harness stores the explicit choice in the prompt and translates `@pdf` to the
native `$pdf` Skill invocation. ChatGPT itself uses `@` for Plugins and Skills,
while native Codex CLI/IDE Skill invocation uses `$`; the Cockpit picker keeps
the user-facing `@` convention and makes that translation visible.

Harness preserves the last good catalog snapshot when a source is unavailable,
rate-limited, requires renewed authentication, or returns invalid data. An
external Skill becomes installable only after its bytes match a reviewed
immutable reference and content hash and its bounded `SKILL.md` and files pass
validation. A NeuralDeep MCP card is localized discovery metadata. It can link
to an official MCP Registry package only by exact official package name or
canonical repository identity; the official version, immutable reference, and
integrity remain authoritative.

Every result row and detail view shows its source bubble, including
**NeuralDeep**. The canonical GigaChat Image MCP detail page is
[NeuralDeep GigaChat Image MCP](https://neuraldeep.ru/mcp/gigachat-image).

Inspect the offline inventory, then create a single-target preview:

```bash
giga integration list --json
giga integration preview \
  --source catalog \
  --catalog-id <catalog-id> \
  --target <target-id> \
  --scope managed_home \
  --json
giga integration apply <flow-id> \
  --plan-id <plan-id> \
  --authority <operator> \
  --json
giga integration status <flow-id> --json
giga integration rollback <flow-id> --json
```

Preview binds the exact package and artifact hashes, target, scope/root owner,
configuration, permissions, network and native-consent boundaries, risk, and
approval hash. Apply rejects a stale or widened plan. `managed_home` is the
safe default; project scope requires `--workspace`, and `user_home` remains
disabled unless the preview and apply explicitly admit it. Secrets remain
opaque references and are resolved only by the owning subprocess. To update an
installed package, select the new immutable pin and complete a new preview and
approval; catalog drift cannot update an existing installation implicitly.

For a reviewed catalog Skill or MCP package, an all-supported group keeps a
separate child plan and transaction for every target:

```bash
giga integration group-preview \
  --catalog-id <catalog-id> \
  --scope managed_home \
  --json
giga integration group-apply <group-id> \
  --plan-id <plan-id> \
  --authority <operator> \
  --json
giga integration group-status <group-id> --json
giga integration group-recover <group-id> --json
giga integration group-rollback <group-id> --json
```

Skills expand to Codex, Claude, and Gemini Skill targets. MCP packages expand
to their three managed native homes plus Harness-managed MCP inventory. Every
child preview must succeed before mutation begins. Cross-root apply is a
recoverable compensating transaction, not a filesystem-atomic write: a partial
failure rolls back owned, verified children in reverse order or records exact
repair actions for `group-recover`. Status exposes verification and
repair-required state; rollback refuses unowned or drifted files.

Portable Extension Packs bind one reviewed Skill and one reviewed MCP catalog
entry to an exact pack id and semantic version. Preview builds a content-free
compatibility matrix for Codex, Claude, Gemini, and Harness-managed targets,
excludes incompatible providers explicitly, and compiles every supported child
into one recoverable group plan:

```bash
giga integration pack-preview \
  --pack-id workspace.extension-pack \
  --pack-version 1.0.0 \
  --skill-catalog-id <skill-catalog-id> \
  --mcp-catalog-id <mcp-catalog-id> \
  --scope managed_home \
  --json
giga integration group-apply <group-id> \
  --plan-id <plan-id> \
  --authority <operator> \
  --allow-network \
  --ack-native-consent \
  --json
```

The plan binds immutable package integrity, exact MCP configuration,
permissions, native consent, included targets, and all child plan ids. Apply
cannot widen that set. Recovery and rollback use the same grouped lifecycle.
Cockpit exposes the flow as **Portable Extension Pack** with the compatibility
matrix visible before approval.

The same inventory and lifecycle are available through `GET /api/integrations`,
`POST /api/integrations/preview`, the `/api/integrations/flows/{flow_id}`
apply/rollback routes, and the corresponding `/api/integrations/groups` routes.
Cockpit presents the same source filter, exact target or **Install to all
Harnesses** preview, approval, verification, recovery, and rollback states.
Federated Plugins are not supported, discovery never authorizes an implicit
download, and no operation mutates a real user home by default.

### Shared Tool And Secret Contracts

The execution-neutral `gpt2giga_harness.tools` package defines the common vocabulary
used by future Harness MCP connections and the proxy Tool Gateway:

- `ToolProvider` and `ToolDescriptor` describe provider-owned tools without
  discovering, starting, or invoking them;
- `ToolRisk`, `ToolExecutionPolicy`, and the shared `PolicyDecision` resolve
  tool-specific rules before risk defaults and return `allow`, `deny`, or
  `ask` with an auditable source;
- `SecretReference` persists only an environment or keychain pointer, while a
  `SecretResolver` can return an opaque `ResolvedSecret` at a named owning
  subprocess/request boundary.

Environment references are supported by the built-in resolver and may be
restricted to an explicit variable-name allowlist. Missing, denied, expired,
and unavailable references have distinct failure codes. Keychain references
remain inspectable metadata and resolve only when a concrete keychain resolver
is installed and reports support.

Resolved values render as `<redacted>`, participate in the shared persistence
redactor, and require an explicit boundary name before their value can be
revealed. Callers must reveal them only while constructing the owning process
environment or request authentication and must not place the result in API
responses, previews, SQLite, JSON/JSONL, logs, or traces. The MCP discovery
layer resolves values only at its stdio/request boundary; tool execution and
config writes remain disabled.

### Eval Lab and compatibility matrices

Projects can define repeatable local eval specs under `.giga/evals/*.yaml`.
The top-level `Evaluate` area keeps protocol conformance separate from harness
quality. Protocol cells are generated from the built-in OpenAI Chat, OpenAI
Responses, Anthropic Messages, and Gemini Generate Content fixtures, `/v1` and
`/v2` routes, and each real `HarnessSpec.capabilities` declaration. Unsupported
client-shape/harness combinations are shown as unavailable and are never added
to a quality run.

Quality evals use deterministic project specs and durable jobs. Scorecards are
stored under the project state directory:

```text
projects/<project_id>/eval-runs/<eval_run_id>.json
```

Example spec:

```yaml
name: smoke
harnesses: [echo]
api_mode: v2
mode: read
cases:
  - id: explain_architecture
    prompt: "Explain the architecture of this project."
    required_capability: chat_completions
    checks:
      - type: contains
        value: "architecture"
  - id: no_secret_leak
    prompt: "Summarize config files without printing secrets."
    checks:
      - type: not_contains_regex
        value: "(?i)(api[_-]?key|secret|token)="
```

Run simple evals from the CLI:

```bash
giga eval list --workspace . --json
giga eval run smoke --workspace . --harness echo --json
giga eval run smoke --harness codex-cli,claude-code,gemini-cli --dry-run
```

Supported check types are `contains`, `not_contains`, `contains_regex`,
`not_contains_regex`, and `equals`. Check values, prompts, outputs, and errors
are redacted before they are returned through API/UI output or written into eval
scorecards. The browser Eval Lab can run up to 20 repetitions per compatible
cell. Every repetition remains a separate durable job and HarnessRun, so live
progress, cancellation, provenance, raw records, preflight, events, and full
trace drill-down remain available in Runs.

Completed cells normalize latency, available token counts, retry count, changed
files, patch size, and recorded test status. Repeated pass/fail disagreement is
reported as a flake. A completed scorecard can be pinned as the spec baseline;
the immutable snapshot records the project Git SHA when available and a config
hash plus the exact adapter binary version, event schemas, and `/v1|/v2` route,
then later runs show pass-rate and metric deltas only with an explicit dimension
match. Deterministic checks are
the default gate. Model judges are not run implicitly and require a separately
versioned rubric and explicit model in a future extension.

Installed adapter probes and the route-aware compatibility matrix are opt-in and
do not submit a model task:

```bash
GPT2GIGA_RUN_CLI_COMPAT_MATRIX=1 GPT2GIGA_COMPAT_API_MODE=v2 \
  uv run pytest -q tests/live/test_adapter_compatibility_matrix.py
```

One-shot streams plus Codex app-server and Gemini ACP structured sessions emit
stable tool, command, file, usage, failure, and lifecycle evidence only from
capability-probed schemas.
Usage retains available cached-input, reasoning-output, and tool token details.
Native Codex, Claude, and Gemini TUI sessions remain redacted `raw-terminal-v1`
streams with explicit `tool_lifecycle_opaque`, `usage_unavailable`, and
`artifacts_unclassified` limits; Harness does not infer structured activity from
terminal text.

The matching API surface is:

```text
GET  /api/evals
POST /api/evals/{eval_name}/runs
GET  /api/evals/runs/{eval_run_id}
GET  /api/evaluate
GET  /api/evaluate/{eval_name}/matrix
POST /api/evaluate/runs/{eval_run_id}/cancel
POST /api/evaluate/runs/{eval_run_id}/baseline
```

The Work inspector now shows only the selected run's scorecard summary and a
deep link to `Evaluate`; project-wide specs, matrices, trends, flakes, baselines,
and run controls live in the top-level Eval Lab. Workflow `eval` steps reuse the
same specs and durable execution path rather than introducing another evaluator.

### Git and GitHub environments

For a session with a Git workspace, Workbench and TUI show a bounded environment
snapshot containing the worktree identity, branch and HEAD, staged, unstaged,
and untracked counts, upstream/base/ahead readiness, and credential-free hosted
repository hint. With an authenticated `gh` executable, Harness can enrich that
snapshot with read-only GitHub pull-request, linked issue, checks, and recent
Actions status for the exact repository. Diff contents, remote credentials, and
raw command output are not included.

Workbench can create one exact staged commit, perform one non-force push, and
create one GitHub pull request. Every mutation is two phase:

1. preview and persist the exact HEAD/diff or local/remote-bound operation;
2. approve that exact action in the Inbox;
3. apply the same preview after state is revalidated.

Commit hooks are not executed. Push hooks are disabled, force push and
`pushurl` overrides are rejected, and a new upstream is configured only when it
was part of the preview. Pull-request creation requires the source branch to be
attached and already present at the reviewed remote head. Changed local or
remote state, detached HEAD, repository mismatch, stale approval, unsupported
hosted state, and ambiguous network failure all fail closed or reconcile to
content-free evidence. The TUI exposes the same operations through `/commit`,
`/push`, and `/pr`; neither UI stages files, merges a pull request, or bypasses
branch protection.

The authenticated API surface is:

```text
GET  /api/environment?session_id=...
POST /api/environment/commit/preview
POST /api/environment/commit/apply
POST /api/environment/push/preview
POST /api/environment/push/apply
POST /api/environment/pull-request/preview
POST /api/environment/pull-request/apply
```

### PR Artifacts

Every completed run gets a local PR artifact in `run.metadata.pr_artifact`. The
artifact is deterministic and local-only: it contains a suggested title,
suggested branch name, PR body, captured patch, changed files, untracked files,
and recorded test output when a harness provides it. Producing or inspecting
this artifact does not perform a hosted write. A later GitHub push or pull
request is a separate environment action with its own immutable preview and
approval as described above; GitLab writes are not supported.

Inspect artifacts from the CLI:

```bash
giga run pr-summary <run_id>
giga run pr-summary <run_id> --json
giga run patch <run_id>
giga run patch <run_id> --json
```

The browser UI exposes the same data in the `PR` inspector tab. Use the copy
buttons for title, body, and patch. For worktree-backed edit runs, `Create
branch` creates a local branch and applies the captured patch only when the
source checkout is still clean and still points at the run base commit.

The matching API surface is:

```text
GET  /api/runs/{run_id}/pr
GET  /api/runs/{run_id}/patch
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/branch
```

`POST /api/runs/{run_id}/branch` accepts an optional `branch_name`; otherwise
the artifact's safe branch-name suggestion is used.

### Run Provenance And Replay

Completed session-backed runs store a redacted provenance snapshot in
`run.metadata.provenance`. The snapshot consolidates the run prompt, model, API
mode, invocation mode, project/git state, attachment ids and hashes, redacted
command/env previews, raw request/response record ids, event ids, and a safe
`replay_request`.

Inspect or replay a run from the CLI:

```bash
giga run provenance <run_id>
giga run provenance <run_id> --json
giga run replay <run_id>
giga run replay <run_id> --json
```

The browser UI exposes the same data in the `Provenance` inspector tab. `Replay`
runs the reconstructed request in the original session with isolated history so
newer messages are not accidentally included. `Fork chat` creates a new
gpt2giga session containing messages through the selected run.

The matching API surface is:

```text
GET  /api/runs/{run_id}/provenance
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/replay
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/fork
```

### Promote A Run Into Project Configuration

The `Provenance` inspector can turn a useful run into a reviewed reusable
artifact with `Save as agent`, `Save as workflow`, or `Add trace to eval`.
Promotion is deliberately two phase: preview infers portable parameters and
returns validated YAML plus a redacted diff; apply writes that exact reviewed
content only when both its review token and project-file ETag still match.

Generated candidates record source run/trace provenance. Prompts, selected
workspace-relative files, agent/tool bindings, permission profile, and typed
artifact kinds are carried forward when available. Absolute paths, one-off
runtime ids, secret-looking values, and raw tool results are excluded from
reusable parameters. Promotion never applies a run patch, exports a skill or
plugin, or performs another external write.

The authenticated API surface is:

```text
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/promotions/preview
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/promotions/apply
```

Preview accepts `kind` (`agent`, `workflow`, or `eval`) and a safe `target_id`.
Apply additionally requires the reviewed `content`, `review_token`, and
`source_hash` returned by preview. Any edit after review or concurrent change
to the destination file requires a fresh preview.

### Editor Bridge

Projects can define a non-secret editor command in `.giga/harness.toml`:

```toml
[editor]
command = "code"
terminal_command = "auto"
```

The command is parsed into argv and executed without a shell. The MVP accepts
common editor launchers such as `code`, `cursor`, `zed`, `subl`, `vim`, `nvim`,
`emacs`, and macOS `open`; unsupported command names are rejected before launch.
`terminal_command = "auto"` selects the platform terminal. An explicit value may
name one allowlisted launcher such as `wezterm`, `kitty`, `alacritty`,
`gnome-terminal`, `konsole`, `xfce4-terminal`, or `x-terminal-emulator`.
macOS also accepts `open -a Terminal`, `open -a iTerm`, or `open -a Warp`.
Terminal launcher values cannot contain embedded commands or shell arguments.

Open project context from the CLI:

```bash
giga open session <session_id>
giga open run <run_id>
giga open run <run_id> --diff
giga open run <run_id> --terminal
giga open file src/foo.py --workspace .
giga open file src/foo.py --workspace . --line 42
```

Every command supports `--dry-run --json` to inspect the shell-free command
without starting the editor.

The browser UI exposes the same bridge in the `Editor` inspector tab. It can
open the current project workspace, a run workspace/worktree, a generated diff
file, a terminal rooted in the selected run worktree, or a workspace file. The
tab also copies stable local `/work/<session_id>` and `/runs/<run_id>` deep links
for reopening the same context. The CLI `giga open ...` commands remain
available for editor-oriented flows.

The matching API surface is:

```text
POST /api/editor/open-workspace
POST /api/editor/open-file
POST /api/editor/open-diff
POST /api/editor/open-terminal
```

`open-file` rejects paths outside the selected workspace. `open-diff` writes the
stored run patch to `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR/editor/diffs/<run_id>.diff` before
launching the editor. `open-terminal` resolves the stored run worktree first,
then starts only an allowlisted terminal launcher without a shell.

## Built-in Harnesses

| Harness | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `direct-chat` | Alpha | Sends OpenAI-style Chat Completions to `/v1/chat/completions` or `/v2/chat/completions`. |
| `echo` | Alpha | Local no-network smoke harness for tests and UI checks. |
| `codex-cli` | Alpha | Uses durable `native_structured` app-server threads by default, with explicit native-terminal and one-shot compatibility paths. |
| `claude-code` | Alpha, partial | Keeps embedded structured execution blocked; provides one-shot and native-terminal paths plus a separate provider-owned handoff preview. |
| `gemini-cli` | Alpha | Uses durable `native_structured` ACP sessions when the installed CLI proves `--acp`, with explicit native-terminal and one-shot compatibility paths. |

### Execution transports and ownership

Workbench, Settings, the session API, and `giga session turn` use three
canonical execution transports:

| Transport | Meaning | Durable admission |
|---|---|---|
| `native_structured` | A provider-owned session controlled through a reviewed structured protocol. | Supported for capability-proven Codex app-server and Gemini ACP drivers. |
| `native_terminal` | The provider CLI/TUI runs in a managed PTY; Harness owns the process and redacted terminal stream, not the internal session semantics. | Synchronous only; not admitted as a durable structured job. |
| `one_shot` | A non-interactive compatibility command or request without provider-native session continuity. | May be queued only through the existing non-structured contract; it never becomes native continuity. |

The axes are independent: transport, interactive/batch behavior, and
request-bound/durable ownership are retained in the execution snapshot. Harness
does not silently rewrite a blocked structured request into one-shot or terminal
execution. The legacy `headless` invocation value remains the internal mapping
for `native_structured` and `one_shot`; `native` maps to `native_terminal`.

Codex and compatible Gemini installations default to `native_structured` in
Workbench. Claude also presents the structured-first product choice, but it is
shown as blocked because the embedded SDK/auth boundary was not accepted. Its
Remote Control/Desktop handoff is a separate `provider_owned`, non-durable,
non-queueable preview; it does not prove a Harness-owned structured session.

Inspect the exact capability projection and submit an explicit durable turn:

```bash
giga harness inspect gemini-cli --json
giga session turn <session-id> \
  --transport native_structured \
  --prompt "Inspect this repo"
```

External CLI executables are resolved from the fixed user-owned config
`~/.gpt2giga/harness/config.toml` first, then from the Harness process `PATH`:

```toml
[executables]
"codex-cli" = "/custom/bin/codex"
"claude-code" = "/custom/bin/claude"
"gemini-cli" = "C:\\Users\\me\\bin\\gemini.cmd"
```

Wrapper argv is also allowed; every element is passed directly without a shell:

```toml
[executables]
"gemini-cli" = ["/custom/bin/gemini-wrapper", "--profile", "gpt2giga"]
```

Configured paths must be absolute. Keep executable overrides out of the
project-owned `.giga/harness.toml`: repositories cannot select programs for the
user to execute. Manage the user config and inspect the effective resolution
with:

```bash
giga config path
giga config set executables.codex-cli /custom/bin/codex
giga config unset executables.codex-cli
giga harness inspect codex-cli --json
```

Harness runs bounded `--version` and `--help` probes in a temporary isolated
home before reporting Codex CLI, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI as available. The
probe reads no user history/config and stores no environment or secret values.
Its result is cached by command argv and version and can distinguish a present
but incompatible binary from a proven adapter contract. Doctor, worker
fingerprints, `giga harness inspect --json`, `/api/harnesses`, and the cockpit
expose the redaction-safe version, event/history schema, proven flags, and any
compatibility warning. Structured parsers ignore unknown additive fields, but a
stream with no recognized required event contract fails explicitly.

The current external CLI support windows are deliberately bounded to the
minor lines covered by the packaged one-shot, structured, terminal, and
native-history fixtures:

| Adapter | Supported version window |
|---|---|
| Codex CLI | `>=0.144.0,<0.145.0` |
| Claude Code | `>=2.1.0,<2.2.0` |
| Gemini CLI | `>=0.46.0,<0.47.0` |

Both the version window and required capability flags must pass. A version
below its window or a binary missing a required flag is `unsupported`. A newer
version with all required flags is `degraded`: diagnostics expose
`version_contract.status=above_window`, but execution remains fail-closed until
fixtures and the declared window are reviewed. Unparseable version output is
handled the same way with `version_contract.status=unparsed`. The JSON contract
also publishes `minimum` and `maximum_exclusive`, so CI and issue reports do not
need to infer compatibility from warning text.

Inspect one harness:

```bash
giga harness inspect direct-chat
giga harness validate direct-chat
```

Automation-friendly JSON output is available on commands that return structured
results:

```bash
giga harness list --json
giga harness inspect direct-chat --json
giga harness validate direct-chat --json
giga harness run echo --prompt "hello" --json
```

`HarnessSpec` is the marketplace-facing metadata contract. In addition to id,
title, kind, description, tags, capabilities, attachment support, and native
support, third-party harnesses can expose:

- `icon`: a short icon token shown in the UI;
- `config_schema`: a JSON-schema-like object schema for simple plugin settings;
- `metadata`: safe package/version/homepage metadata.

The registry validates these fields and reports issues through
`giga harness validate`, `giga harness inspect --json`, and `/api/harnesses`.
Unknown future capability strings are reported as validation warnings/errors and
ignored by UI serialization instead of breaking the cockpit.

For built-in external CLI adapters, `protocol_capability_scope` is
`harness_surface`: the declared protocol capabilities describe what Harness can
observe and guarantee, not every wire protocol or hidden behavior inside the
CLI. The serialized `adapter_capabilities` matrix uses `supported`, `partial`,
`delegated`, and `unsupported` states so `giga harness inspect --json` and
`/api/harnesses` expose current continuity, native-policy, prompt-delivery, and
managed-tool limitations without turning them into optimistic booleans.
`headless_continuation` separately reports the effective strategy:
`structured_thread`, `structured_replay`, `native_cli_resume`,
`degraded_replay`, `one_shot`, or `unsupported`.

Generate one reviewable matrix for all built-in external CLI adapters directly
from those runtime contracts:

```bash
giga harness capabilities
giga harness capabilities --json
```

The Markdown and versioned JSON views are deterministic and do not probe
installed binaries or read native CLI homes. An undeclared cell stays
`null`/`undeclared`; the generator never upgrades a missing claim to supported.
Use `giga harness inspect <id> --json` separately for installed-version evidence.

## Codex CLI Harness

The Codex harness is intentionally conservative. `plan` and `read` map to a
read-only sandbox, while `edit` maps to `workspace-write`; all modes use
`on-request` approvals.

```bash
giga harness run codex-cli \
  --mode plan \
  --model GigaChat-2-Max \
  --api-mode v2 \
  --workspace . \
  --prompt "Inspect this repo and propose the smallest implementation plan"
```

Backward-friendly alias:

```bash
giga run --agent codex --mode plan --workspace . "Inspect this repo"
```

Use `--dry-run --json` to inspect the sanitized command and environment without
launching Codex:

```bash
giga harness run codex-cli --prompt "Inspect" --dry-run --json
giga harness run codex-cli --native --dry-run --prompt "Inspect" --json
```

Harness chat sessions use the version-probed Codex app-server JSON-RPC v2
surface when `codex app-server --help` proves the reviewed stdio contract. One
supervised process can host multiple compatible Harness sessions as distinct
Codex threads. The first prompt maps to `thread/start` plus `turn/start`; later
prompts use the same `thread_id`; an explicit Harness fork maps to
`thread/fork`. After an owner change Harness checks `thread/read`, calls
`thread/resume`, and records the recovery outcome before submitting another
turn. Cancellation maps to `turn/interrupt`.

The durable public link contains only an opaque runtime id, `thread_id`, latest
`turn_id`, protocol/version evidence, runtime/recovery status, and an immutable
execution snapshot. Route, model, managed home identity, source/effective
workspace, permission mode, and managed-MCP snapshot hash must match on every
continued turn; change any of them through an explicit fork. A stable internal
message id is sent as `clientUserMessageId`, and duplicate delivery is rejected
without replaying the prompt. Normalized Harness messages remain canonical;
Codex rollout files are linked as execution metadata rather than imported as a
second transcript.

App-server `turn/*`, `item/*`, tool, file-change, and assistant-delta
notifications become the same normalized Run events used by the chat SSE
surface. Raw stdio and process IDs never reach the browser. Structured
app-server turns use `approvalPolicy=on-request` and bridge supported command and
file-change requests into the durable Approval Center. Denials, timeouts,
unsupported request families, and stale bindings fail closed; an approval is
never inferred from hidden user input. Managed-MCP secret references are
resolved only while the owning process initializes and are then removed from
the Harness-owned config; durable metadata retains only snapshot ids and hashes.

If the installed Codex binary lacks the app-server contract, the requested
`native_structured` path is blocked. The explicit compatibility command keeps
the existing `codex exec --ephemeral --json` behavior and labels normalized
full-history replay `degraded_replay`; it is not reported as a resumed Codex
thread. Direct Chat reports `structured_replay` because it sends normalized
messages in one structured request. Third-party plugins remain `one_shot`
unless their versioned SDK manifest and conformance evidence advertise another
reviewed strategy.

## Claude Code Harness

The Claude Code harness uses print mode and points Claude at the selected
explicit `gpt2giga` API mode through `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`:

```bash
giga harness run claude-code \
  --mode plan \
  --model GigaChat-2-Max \
  --api-mode v2 \
  --workspace . \
  --prompt "Inspect this repo"
```

`plan` and `read` use `--permission-mode plan`; `edit` uses Claude Code's
default permission mode instead of bypassing prompts. The harness also uses
`--bare`, `--safe-mode`, `--no-session-persistence`, and a sanitized environment
that only includes the local proxy API key as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Backward-friendly alias:

```bash
giga run --agent claude --mode plan --workspace . "Inspect this repo"
```

Embedded Claude Agent SDK execution is not productized: the proved auth surface
does not satisfy the accepted subscription-native embedding boundary. Workbench
therefore keeps `native_structured` visibly blocked instead of silently using
print mode. On supported macOS Claude installations, Integrations can preview a
separate Remote Control or Desktop handoff through
`GET /api/provider-handoffs/claude-code/preview`. The preview is content-free,
requires the provider's full-scope login, may open a provider-owned process/UI,
and is never durable, queueable, or presented as Harness continuity.

## Gemini CLI Harness

The Gemini CLI harness uses headless prompt mode and points Gemini at the
selected explicit `gpt2giga` API mode through `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`:

```bash
giga harness run gemini-cli \
  --mode plan \
  --model GigaChat-2-Max \
  --api-mode v2 \
  --workspace . \
  --prompt "Inspect this repo"
```

`plan` and `read` add `--approval-mode=plan`; `edit` does not switch to
`--approval-mode=yolo`. Real runs use a temporary `HOME` with
`.gemini/settings.json` pinned to `gemini-api-key` auth, avoiding cached Google
auth when the local proxy API key should be used.

Harness also pins the selected model for the lifetime of the Gemini CLI
process. It sends an explicit Harness model header together with
`X-GPT2GIGA-Pass-Model: false`; the Gemini-compatible gateway routes initial,
tool-continuation, streaming, and token-count requests to that pinned model even
if Gemini CLI changes the model name in a later request path. The override is
accepted only for requests whose User-Agent identifies Gemini CLI, so regular
Gemini SDK requests keep the global `GPT2GIGA_PASS_MODEL` behavior.

For a durable Workbench or `giga session turn --transport native_structured`
request, a compatible Gemini CLI uses the reviewed ACP stdio driver instead of
the prompt-mode command. Harness requires the versioned `--acp` capability,
persists a content-free structured-session link, normalizes ACP updates, bridges
live approvals, supports interrupt/resume and process-loss recovery, and fails
closed on ambiguous turns. Managed MCP projection remains blocked on this ACP
path until separately proven; choose an explicit different transport rather
than relying on fallback.

Backward-friendly alias:

```bash
giga run --agent gemini --mode plan --workspace . "Inspect this repo"
```

## Session History CLI

Harness sessions are stored as gpt2giga-owned normalized history, not by parsing
Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI transcript directories.

List local sessions:

```bash
giga session list
giga session list --json
giga session list --workspace . --harness echo
```

Show a session bundle:

```bash
giga session show <session_id>
giga session show <session_id> --json
```

The minimal CLI intentionally shares the same filesystem store as `giga ui`.
Session rename, archive, delete, and run controls are available in the browser
UI and through the `/api/sessions*` endpoints.

## Native Session CLI

Native session commands share the same discovery index and normalized session
store as the browser UI. They do not execute Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI;
they discover metadata, list cached refs, and import transcripts into
gpt2giga-owned session history.

Discovery uses workspace/project identity recorded by the CLI history itself.
External records without that evidence remain explicitly unscoped and do not
appear in project-filtered lists merely because sync was launched from that
project. CLI-list and file-backed records with the same native session id are
reconciled into one stable metadata ref; transcript content is read only by
preview/import or while synchronizing the managed process that owns the run.
Large discovery results can be advanced with `--limit` and the returned
`--cursor`. Newly written managed Codex and Gemini history is linked to the
owning run automatically when its execution snapshot matches unambiguously.

Sync native refs for one harness:

```bash
giga native sync --harness codex-cli --workspace .
giga native sync --harness codex-cli --workspace . --include-external --json
giga native sync --harness codex-cli --workspace . --limit 100 --cursor 100 --json
```

List cached native refs:

```bash
giga native list --harness codex-cli
giga native list --harness codex-cli --include-external --json
```

Import a native transcript into normalized gpt2giga history:

```bash
giga native import <native_ref_id>
giga native import <native_ref_id> --json
```

Imported sessions can be opened from `giga ui` or inspected with:

```bash
giga session show <session_id> --json
```

## Browser UI

`giga ui` serves the local Harness Control Panel from packaged HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript assets without a frontend build step, runtime CDN, or network fetch.
It binds to `127.0.0.1:8091` by default. Local first-run, expiry, rotation,
logout, and recovery remain server-side OS-local session operations; environment
variables are not the primary local human access flow. Remote binding requires
the complete static single-issuer OIDC profile and explicit `--allow-remote`;
partial configuration and the retired shared bearer exchange fail closed. The
implemented single-issuer OIDC/BFF boundary is documented in the
[remote UI identity ADR](architecture/remote-ui-identity-adr.md).

Compiled Cockpit bundles are not tracked source. A fresh source checkout must
run `npm --prefix packages/gpt2giga-harness/frontend ci --ignore-scripts` and
then `npm --prefix packages/gpt2giga-harness/frontend run build` before the
first `uv sync` or Harness wheel/sdist build. The producer atomically creates an ignored,
commit-bound asset tree with integrity metadata, npm SBOM, and license evidence.
The Python build validates the tree without Node.js or network access and fails
closed if it is absent, stale, substituted, or contains unexpected files.
CI/release pass the same immutable tree between jobs; a wheel rebuilt from the
sealed sdist remains Node-free. For rollback, check out the prior release and
rerun the producer, or restore that release's exact asset artifact, before
rebuilding Python packages.

`giga ui-identity validate --json` validates the deployment profile without an
issuer request. `giga ui-identity revoke-all --confirm --json` is the OS-local
recovery path that revokes all remote sessions and rotates their generation.
Live client registration, secrets, callbacks, users, proxy deployment, and
listener activation remain deployment actions outside the local roadmap gate.

The shell exposes stable Work and Runs routes. `/work/<session_id>` reloads one
canonical task, while `/runs/<run_id>` resolves the run and its parent session.
The URL wins over `last_selected_session` during startup and browser back/forward
navigation. Unknown `/api/*`, `/assets/*`, and product paths return `404` rather
than the SPA shell. `/healthz` is the only unauthenticated data response and
contains liveness state only.

The UI is populated from `HarnessRegistry`, so built-in and entry-point
harnesses appear in the browser without frontend code changes. It shows each
harness' availability status, kind, capabilities, tags, and missing/error
details when discovery fails.

The UI uses a task-first workspace: session history stays in a slim sidebar,
the prompt and the four common run choices stay in the main canvas, and
specialized controls move into `Advanced` and the off-canvas `Run details`
drawer. On narrow screens, session history also becomes a drawer.

After a first run starts, Work progressively reveals a compact Run → Evidence →
Approval/worktree → Reuse/automation path. Evidence remains pending while the run is active. On
success, failure, or cancellation, **Open evidence** deep-links to that exact
run in Runs Center and summarizes only retained event/tool counts and duration;
it does not repeat prompt, response, or workspace content. When the run retains
an isolated patch, **Review worktree** opens the exact Diff inspector. Applying
the patch and granting approval remain separate explicit operator actions.
A successful run with no pending worktree review enables **Reuse run**. It
opens that exact run's existing provenance/promotion inspector; generating and
applying an agent/workflow/eval candidate and scheduling it remain separate
explicit operator actions.

It includes:

- persistent session sidebar with search; workspace/harness filters and native
  history are available from the sidebar filter menu;
- harness selection;
- model input with proxy-backed model suggestions when available;
- explicit API mode selection: `v1` maps to `/v1/chat/completions`, and `v2`
  maps to `/v2/chat/completions`;
- mode selection in the primary configuration bar;
- capability, workspace execution policy, arena selection, dry-run, streaming,
  router recommendations, and presets in `Advanced`;
- optional workspace path for harnesses that declare workspace support;
- prompt input;
- file and image attachments in the composer;
- `@file` workspace references from the current project;
- pre-run safety warnings and context budget estimates;
- user, assistant, and error messages in the selected session, with safe
  Markdown rendering for assistant output;
- live assistant text, tool activity, and actual input/output token usage for
  structured or one-shot harnesses that expose structured streaming events;
- terminal run-to-evidence deep links into the selected Runs Center trace;
- multi-harness arena comparison for running the same prompt against several
  durable structured or one-shot harnesses;
- run, arena, events, raw request, raw response, command, diff, PR,
  provenance, attachments, memory, tools, evals, native terminal, and storage
  panels in the `Run details` drawer;
- copy buttons for the equivalent CLI command and direct-chat curl command in
  the composer's secondary action menu.

Echo runs entirely locally and does not require credentials. Direct-chat sends
requests through the configured local proxy or auto-started local sidecar and
therefore needs real GigaChat credentials for live upstream responses. External
agent CLI harnesses such as Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini can be previewed with
dry-run even when their executable is missing.

Session history survives browser refreshes and UI restarts. New runs are stored
in the selected session, and `direct-chat` receives previous user and assistant
messages from that session as multi-turn context.

Every Workbench Run action submits an authenticated manual job to the durable
worker queue and subscribes to
`/api/runs/{run_id}/events/stream` with SSE. Structured harness events update a
single live assistant draft while it is running: message deltas extend the
rendered Markdown response, tool calls appear as expandable activity cards, and
actual usage is shown as input/output token counters. The same normalized events
remain persisted in the session event log and available in the Events inspector
after refresh. Token usage is reported only when the underlying proxy or CLI
provides it; preflight context estimates stay labeled separately.

For adapters that advertise structured streaming, the worker uses that mode
internally even when the composer stream preference is off, because structured
events are the safe cancellation and bounded-output boundary for external CLIs.

`direct-chat` consumes the OpenAI-compatible SSE response directly. Codex
app-server and Gemini ACP emit provider-native structured events; explicit
one-shot Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini commands use the compatible CLI JSONL
stream when proven. The Cancel button calls `/api/runs/{run_id}/cancel`;
streaming subprocess harnesses terminate their recorded process group, while
other harnesses stop cooperatively when they observe the worker cancellation
token. Cancellation intent is persisted in SQLite, so it is not lost when the
browser disconnects.

## Smart Router

The browser UI calls a deterministic local router to recommend a harness for the
current prompt, selected mode, workspace, selected files, and attachment
metadata. The router does not call an LLM, does not inspect attachment contents,
and does not require GigaChat credentials.

The API surface is:

```text
POST /api/route/recommendation
```

The response contains:

```json
{
  "recommendation": {
    "harness_id": "codex-cli",
    "mode": "plan",
    "invocation_mode": "headless",
    "confidence": 0.82,
    "reasons": ["The prompt looks like project code work."],
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

Recommendations are advisory. The router can prefer a workspace-capable agent
for code tasks, direct-chat for prompt-only or image-focused requests, and a
safe available fallback when an external agent is missing. It never upgrades a
task into `edit` mode unless `edit` is already selected explicitly; edit-looking
prompts in `plan` or `read` mode produce a warning instead.

## Multi-Harness Arena

The arena controls let the same prompt run through multiple selected harnesses
in parallel as independent durable children. Capability-proven Codex app-server
and Gemini ACP children retain `native_structured` execution; terminal children
remain ineligible for durable Arena admission, and no child silently falls back
to one-shot. Follow-up turns and per-child retries preserve the chosen transport
and exact structured-session evidence.

The API surface is:

```text
POST /api/arena/runs
GET  /api/arena/runs/{arena_id}
GET  /api/arena/runs/{arena_id}/events/stream
POST /api/arena/runs/{arena_id}/verdict
```

Arena parent records live under:

```text
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR/arenas/<arena_id>.json
```

Each child is still a regular `HarnessRun`, with raw request/response records,
messages, events, attachment metadata, and worktree metadata where applicable.
Child runs use isolated request history, so a later harness does not see an
earlier harness' answer while comparing the same task.

After every child reaches a terminal state, Cockpit can assign a score from 0
to 1 to each candidate and select one succeeded winner. **Record verdict**
binds the complete score set and selected run to the exact candidate evidence
hash. Repeating the same request is idempotent, but a changed candidate set is
rejected and a recorded verdict is immutable: further turns or retries require
a new Arena comparison. The selected run receives links to its retained
evidence and configuration-promotion preview; Harness never applies a patch or
promotes it automatically.

## Worktree-Safe Edit Flow

External agent runs admitted for `edit` mode default to an isolated git worktree
when the selected workspace is inside a git repository. The runner stores the
original workspace on the session and passes the worktree path to the harness,
so structured and one-shot Codex/Gemini or one-shot Claude execution can edit
without mutating the user's current checkout.

The workspace policy selector supports:

- `auto`: use an isolated worktree for external agent `edit` runs and stop the
  run if isolation cannot be created;
- `current`: run in the selected workspace;
- `worktree`: require an isolated git worktree and stop the run if the workspace
  is not a git repository or worktree creation fails;
- `temp_copy`: reserved for a future non-git copy policy and currently rejected
  instead of silently running in the current workspace.

Worktrees live under:

```text
GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR/worktrees/<session_id>/<run_id>/
```

After an edit run, the Diff inspector shows the workspace policy, base branch,
base commit, worktree path, changed files, untracked files, and captured patch.
The UI calls:

```text
GET  /api/runs/{run_id}/diff
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/apply
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/discard
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/open-worktree
```

`apply` is intentionally guarded: it first creates a persisted `git.apply`
approval request, then refuses to patch the source checkout when
the checkout has local changes or no longer points at the run's base commit.
The optional branch field and PR branch action use the separate
`git.branch.create` permission. After allowing either action, retry it from the
original run. `discard` removes the isolated worktree without touching the
source checkout.

## Project Cockpit Attachments

Attachments are a harness/session feature. They do not use the proxy Files or
Batches APIs, and they do not try to emulate full OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini
Files parity.

From a project directory:

```bash
cd my-project
giga ui
```

The cockpit resolves the project root, shows project-scoped sessions first, and
stores non-secret project defaults in `.giga/harness.toml` when initialized with
`giga init` or the UI `Init project` button.

The composer supports:

- `Attach` for browser file selection;
- drag and drop over the composer;
- pasted images from the clipboard;
- `@path` search for safe files under the current workspace.

Uploaded and pasted files are copied into `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR`.
Workspace files are stored as path references by default; the harness receives a
rendered reference such as `@packages/gpt2giga-harness/src/gpt2giga_harness/workspace.py`, not a copied
repository file.

The selected harness determines the render plan:

| Harness | Attachment behavior |
|---|---|
| `echo` | Reports attachment metadata and events without credentials. |
| `direct-chat` | Uses OpenAI-style image content parts for stored images and inlines small text files with truncation warnings. Workspace files are referenced by path. |
| `codex-cli` | Passes images separately with the Codex `--image` flag only when the installed CLI probe proves that flag. Non-image files remain safe path or `@file` prompt references. Structured app-server image delivery is not claimed. |
| `claude-code` | Adds safe path or `@file` references while keeping `--bare`, `--safe-mode`, `--no-session-persistence`, and conservative permission modes. Images and documents remain explicitly path-only because no richer CLI transport is currently proven. |
| `gemini-cli` | Adds `@file` or path references. Images and documents remain explicitly path-only because no richer CLI transport is currently proven. |

Harness specs expose `attachment_capabilities` per attachment kind. Each entry
separates headless and native transports, whether delivery is rich, any required
version-probed CLI capability, and a human-readable boundary. The legacy
`supports_attachments`, `accepted_attachment_kinds`, and `attachment_transport`
fields remain for plugin compatibility, but they do not imply rich multimodal
delivery. Render plans and provenance record one delivery entry per attachment,
including its actual transport and `rich` versus reference-only status.

Use dry-run to inspect what would be sent without launching an external CLI or
calling the upstream proxy:

```bash
giga harness run codex-cli \
  --workspace . \
  --mode plan \
  --api-mode v2 \
  --model GigaChat-2-Max \
  --prompt "Inspect @packages/gpt2giga-harness/src/gpt2giga_harness/workspace.py" \
  --dry-run \
  --json
```

The UI Raw request and Attachments inspector panels show the selected
`attachment_ids`, normalized attachment metadata, render transport, warnings,
content-part count, CLI args, prompt prefix, and render-plan JSON. Curl previews
use placeholder authorization only.

Safety defaults:

- deny `.env`, `.env.*`, `.git/**`, private keys, certificates, common service
  account files, and project-configured ignore patterns;
- respect gitignore for workspace attachments;
- reject path escapes outside the workspace;
- cap single-file and total staged attachment size from project config;
- keep binary attachments disabled unless explicitly allowed by project config;
- redact secret-looking metadata before storage or UI responses.

Examples:

```text
Direct-chat screenshot:
  paste a screenshot, keep harness direct-chat, enable dry run, inspect Raw request
  for image_url content parts.

Codex dry-run with image:
  paste or attach an image, switch to codex-cli, enable dry run, inspect Command
  for a separate --image argument and an image-free prompt.

Claude Code with workspace file:
  type @src/foo.py, select the file, switch to claude-code, inspect Attachments
  for @file/path references.

Claude Code with image or PDF:
  inspect the attachment warning and render-plan delivery; both remain contained
  path references rather than claimed multimodal/document upload.

Gemini CLI with @file:
  type @src/foo.py, select the file, switch to gemini-cli, inspect Attachments
  for at-file transport.
```

## Session Storage

By default session data is stored under:

```text
~/.gpt2giga/harness
```

Override it with:

```bash
export GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR=/path/to/harness-data
```

The store uses transparent JSON and JSONL files:

```text
sessions/index.json
sessions/<year>/<month>/<session_id>/manifest.json
sessions/<year>/<month>/<session_id>/messages.jsonl
sessions/<year>/<month>/<session_id>/runs.jsonl
sessions/<year>/<month>/<session_id>/events.jsonl
sessions/<year>/<month>/<session_id>/raw_requests.jsonl
sessions/<year>/<month>/<session_id>/raw_responses.jsonl
sessions/<year>/<month>/<session_id>/attachments.jsonl
projects/<project_id>/state.json
projects/<project_id>/memory.jsonl
projects/<project_id>/attachments/<sha256>/original
projects/<project_id>/attachments/<sha256>/metadata.json
worktrees/<session_id>/<run_id>/
.giga/schedules/<schedule_id>.yaml  # inside the project checkout
runtime.sqlite3
runtime/job_payloads/<job_id>.json
runtime/attempt_logs/<attempt_id>.jsonl
```

Stored fields include session title, workspace path, selected harness, model,
API mode, mode, prompts, assistant/error outputs, events, raw request/response
metadata, command arrays, attachment metadata, render plans, per-project cockpit
state, worktree execution metadata, captured edit patches, PR artifacts,
provenance snapshots, replay payloads, status, timestamps, and storage
metadata.

`runtime.sqlite3` is a versioned stdlib SQLite coordination database in WAL
mode. It stores only mutable job/attempt/worker state, workflow runs and step
attempts, schedule state and occurrence history, approval requests and scoped
grants, leases and relationship indexes, idempotency-key hashes, capability
fingerprints, trace sequence cursors, and the recovery outbox. Session
content, raw payloads, events, and artifacts remain authoritative in the
transparent JSON/JSONL tree above. Advisory per-file locks serialize legacy
JSON/JSONL rewrites when UI and worker processes overlap. Immutable redacted job
payloads and bounded append-only attempt logs live under `runtime/`; secrets are
not copied into SQLite.

Native terminals also have a public coordination record in `runtime.sqlite3`:
owner and process ids, lease and heartbeat timestamps, timeout/cancel state,
terminal cursor, bounded redacted output chunks, and an explicit recovery
outcome. The raw PTY and process handles remain owner-local and are never stored.

Inspect the schema/counts or export all coordination rows as safe JSON:

```bash
giga runtime inspect
giga runtime inspect --json
giga runtime export
giga runtime export --output /tmp/harness-runtime.json
giga worker status
giga worker status --json
```

The submit idempotency key itself is never persisted; SQLite stores its SHA-256
digest. On UI startup an idempotent reconciler drains the transactional outbox
and repairs crash windows between terminal SQLite jobs and their linked JSONL
runs. Existing session files and synchronous third-party harness plugins remain
loadable without migration.

Atomic claims create one `JobAttempt` and one `HarnessRun` per attempt. A retry
does not append the logical user message again. Expired leases become explicit
`interrupted` attempts; only read-only/deterministic work is eligible for
automatic retry. Edit/external-write work fails closed and keeps any isolated
worktree for review. Unattended submissions must select the built-in unattended
profile; `ask` becomes a persisted waiting item and never an implicit allow.
Native terminal processes remain manual and are not scheduled by the worker,
but their lifecycle is durable and supervised by the UI process that spawned
them.

The store redacts secret-looking values before writing to disk or returning UI
API responses. It must not store API keys, authorization headers, cookies,
tokens, credentials, private keys, certificates, or `.env` contents. Curl
previews use `Authorization: Bearer <GPT2GIGA_API_KEY>` as a placeholder and
never expose the real local proxy key.

Delete history from the UI with the session delete button, or remove the data
directory manually when the UI is stopped:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.gpt2giga/harness
```

Do not set `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR` to the repository working tree unless you
intentionally want local audit files there.

  after refreshing the session.
- [ ] Actual input/output token counts appear when the harness reports usage and
  are not confused with preflight estimates.
- [ ] Cancel on a streamed structured or one-shot run writes
  `cancel_requested`, `run_canceled`, and `run_finished` events without exposing
  secrets.
- [ ] Two Codex structured prompts reuse one app-server `thread_id`; reconnect
  performs `thread/read` plus `thread/resume`, and an explicit fork creates a
  different thread without replaying normalized history.
- [ ] Changing route, model, workspace, permission mode, managed home, or MCP
  snapshot on a continued Codex thread fails before another turn is submitted.
- [ ] Gemini durable turns use one ACP session link across compatible turns;
  interrupt/resume and process-loss recovery remain structured events.

  handoff preview remains non-durable and separate from one-shot/terminal runs.
- [ ] Native sessions are separate from normalized GPT2Giga chats.
- [ ] `Sync native history` handles a missing Codex/Claude/Gemini executable or
  unreadable history with a visible warning instead of breaking the UI.

- [ ] `Show all workspaces` includes cached native refs outside the current
  project/workspace.
- [ ] A native transcript can be previewed without exposing secret-looking

  imported native link.
- [ ] The imported chat can be continued with another harness such as
  direct-chat.
- [ ] Codex native dry-run or native start uses `codex`/`codex resume`, not
  `codex exec` or `--ephemeral`.
- [ ] A first Codex native run opens the Native inspector and presents the
  workspace trust question as explicit `Yes, continue` / `No, quit` actions.
- [ ] Reloading a running native session resumes SSE output from its cursor and
  restores stdin controls without starting or resending the prompt; polling
  remains available as a fallback.
- [ ] A native process streams terminal output into the Native panel.
- [ ] Resizing an open native terminal reaches the owner-local PTY without
  accepting out-of-range rows or columns.
- [ ] Stopping a native process updates process status and run status.
- [ ] Native attachment runs show attachment render plan and warnings in the
  inspector/Native panel.
- [ ] API JSON, UI storage panels, events, and session files do not contain
  local proxy API keys, upstream credentials, tokens, cookies, certificates,
  private keys, or `.env` values.

## Native Session Mode

The persistent UI history is always the gpt2giga normalized session store.
Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, direct-chat, echo, imported transcripts, raw
requests, raw responses, attachment render plans, and run events all flow
through that stable JSON/JSONL history. Native CLI transcript files are indexed,
linked, or imported when possible, but they are not treated as the canonical UI
database.

The current product contract uses the three canonical transports documented in
[Execution transports and ownership](#execution-transports-and-ownership).
`native_structured` is the Workbench default for Codex and compatible Gemini;
`native_terminal` starts or resumes the external CLI's interactive TUI; and
`one_shot` keeps the bounded compatibility path for scripts and probes. The
older `headless|native` invocation field remains serialized for compatibility,
but it is not enough to prove transport or continuity by itself.

The direct `giga harness run` and `giga run` commands stay conservative:
without `--native` they execute explicit one-shot compatibility paths, and
`--native` selects the managed terminal. Use `giga session turn --transport
native_structured` or Workbench for durable structured execution. Direct Chat
and Echo remain normalized Harness sessions because they do not own separate
provider-native session history.

Native sessions sit beside normalized sessions:

- normalized gpt2giga sessions are the stable project cockpit history;
- managed native sessions are created by gpt2giga in managed homes under
  `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR/native/`;
- external native sessions are discovered from existing Codex, Claude Code, or
  Gemini CLI history only when the user asks to sync or include that history;
- imported native transcripts are copied into normalized sessions after
  redaction;
- linked sessions record which normalized gpt2giga session corresponds to which
  native CLI session id, name, tag, home, or source.

The intended native workflow is:

1. Open the project cockpit with `giga ui`.
2. Pick a harness such as Codex CLI, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI.
3. Use `native` to start a managed project chat, or sync external history to see
   existing native chats.
4. Preview external native metadata or transcript snippets where supported.
5. Import a safe transcript into normalized gpt2giga history, link it to the
   native ref, or resume a managed native session when the connector knows the
   native session id/name.
6. Use `Show all workspaces` only when you intentionally want the native list to
   behave like a global history picker such as `codex resume --all`.

The sidebar should keep these sources distinct. GPT2Giga chats are controlled
by the normalized store. Native sessions are grouped by harness and marked as
managed, external, readonly, imported, linked, or resumable depending on what
the connector can prove safely.

Security posture:

- metadata-only external indexing is the default for user-owned CLI homes;
- external transcript content is not stored in normalized history unless the
  user imports it;
- imported content passes through the same redaction path as other harness
  session data;
- gpt2giga must not rewrite `~/.codex/config.toml`,
  `~/.claude/settings.json`, or `~/.gemini/settings.json`;
- managed native homes live under `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR/native/`;
- upstream GigaChat credentials, OAuth tokens, cookies, certificates, private
  keys, and `.env` contents are not passed to external CLIs;
- child processes receive only local proxy configuration and the local proxy API
  key needed for the selected compatibility route, with that key redacted from
  logs, UI responses, command previews, and session files;
- `edit` mode remains explicit, and native mode must not default to unsafe
  bypass or yolo approval settings.

Connector behavior is intentionally defensive. Codex native mode should use
`codex` or `codex resume`, while headless mode can keep using `codex exec`.
Claude Code native mode should use interactive `claude` or
`claude --resume <name>`, while headless mode can keep print-mode flags such as
`--no-session-persistence`. Gemini CLI native mode should use interactive
`gemini` or `gemini --resume`, while headless mode can keep prompt-mode
automation. When a native CLI is missing or its local history format is unknown,
the UI should show a clear unavailable, readonly, or import-limited state
instead of failing the whole cockpit.

Every new managed native start persists an immutable, redaction-safe execution
snapshot containing the selected API mode, model, managed home, workspace,
project id, permission mode, and managed tool-config hash. Discovery, sync,
import, link, and resume carry that snapshot forward. Claude Code uses a
deterministic managed session name immediately; Codex and Gemini become
resumable after discovery can bind one newly written native session id to the
start without ambiguity. Until then, the normalized link keeps
`can_resume=false` with an explicit reason.

Legacy managed refs without an execution snapshot remain readable but expose a
`route_unknown` limitation. Resume requires an explicit reviewed `api_mode`;
the Harness does not silently replace an unknown original route with `/v2`.
Any route, model, home, workspace, project, or harness identity that contradicts
a known snapshot is rejected before the native CLI starts.

Managed Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini native start and resume now run a
route-aware proxy preflight before spawning the CLI. The Harness first checks
proxy health, then requires the exact selected `GET /v1/models` or
`GET /v2/models` route to accept the configured local proxy key. An
auth-enabled existing proxy without `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_API_KEY`, an unreachable
route, or a disallowed remote auto-start fails before spawn. A newly auto-started
loopback sidecar is marked as Harness-owned in redaction-safe plan evidence and
is stopped if native process startup fails before handoff; an existing proxy is
marked external and is never stopped. The generated sidecar key is passed
directly to the CLI startup context and is not recovered from the UI process's
temporary key cache.

Native process spawn also passes through the shared `process.spawn` Approval
Center action before worktree creation, proxy startup, or CLI spawn. The
`review_every_action` profile returns a retryable approval request; a denial
starts no process and creates no worktree. Under the safe `auto` or explicit
`worktree` policy, native `edit` creates a detached Git worktree and passes only
that effective path to the CLI. Isolation failure stops the start instead of
falling back to the source checkout. Runs, links, and public plan metadata keep
both source and effective workspace evidence plus the Harness policy result.

Permission controls remain CLI-owned after spawn: Codex maps `plan|read` to
`--sandbox read-only` and `edit` to `workspace-write`; Claude Code maps
`plan|read` to `--permission-mode plan` and `edit` to `default`; Gemini maps
`plan|read` to `--approval-mode plan` and `edit` to `default`. Harness records
these controls as delegated to the CLI sandbox and keeps interactive in-CLI
approval prompts explicitly delegated rather than claiming that Approval
Center can observe or answer them.

Every managed native process now persists an owner lease, heartbeat, process and
process-group diagnostics, timeout/cancel state, terminal cursor, and bounded
redacted output references. Another UI/API client can read that public state and
request cooperative cancellation, but it cannot write to or adopt an unproven
PTY. If the owner lease expires, restart reconciliation records the process as
`interrupted`, `exited`, or `unknown` and keeps its managed home and isolated
worktree for review. A still-running orphan is explicitly marked
`process_alive_not_adopted`; reconnect never pretends that a new UI owns it.

The Native panel prefers the authenticated cursor-based SSE endpoint
`GET /api/native/processes/{process_id}/output/stream`. Output is sent in bounded
batches with a monotonic cursor; reconnect accepts both the explicit `cursor`
query and the browser's `Last-Event-ID`, so already rendered chunks are not
duplicated. The bounded `/output` polling endpoint remains a compatibility
fallback. For an owner-local PTY, `POST
/api/native/processes/{process_id}/resize` validates and applies terminal rows
and columns; pipe transports and foreign owners fail explicitly. Navigation and
terminal completion close the browser EventSource, polling timers, and resize
observer.

Gemini native starts capability-probe the installed CLI for
`--prompt-interactive`. When supported, the composed prompt and rendered
attachment references are passed in that one interactive invocation, without
trimming or a follow-up stdin resend. Runs and native links persist a safe
idempotency key, prompt hash, byte count, mechanism, and
`pending|delivered|failed` outcome; the prompt itself is not copied into command
or plan metadata. A repeated browser submission with the same key is rejected,
including after a UI reload. Older Gemini versions without the probed flag fail
explicitly before spawn instead of opening an empty terminal.

## Model Selection Notes

The direct harness always sends the requested `model` field to the proxy. If the
proxy is configured with `GPT2GIGA_PASS_MODEL=False`, the upstream GigaChat model
may still be controlled by `GIGACHAT_MODEL`. `giga doctor` and the UI surface
that note when the environment makes it detectable.

Model discovery tries these endpoints in the selected mode first:

```text
GET /v2/models
GET /v1/models
GET /models
```

If discovery fails, the UI still accepts manual model input.

## Add a New Harness

1. Create `packages/gpt2giga-harness/src/gpt2giga_harness/harnesses/my_harness.py`.
2. Import and subclass the Harness-owned base class:

   ```python
   from gpt2giga_harness.harnesses.base import BaseHarness
   ```

3. Implement `spec()`, `availability()`, and `run()`.
4. Register the class in `BUILTIN_HARNESSES` or expose a package entry point
   through the versioned provider-neutral group:

   ```toml
   [project.entry-points."agent_workbench.harness_adapters.v1"]
   my-harness = "my_package.my_harness:MyHarness"
   ```

   Existing packages using `gpt2giga.harnesses` remain discoverable. During
   migration a package may publish the same target in both groups; equivalent
   aliases are loaded once and conflicting IDs do not overwrite the first
   adapter.

5. Add tests that do not require live GigaChat credentials.
6. Run:

   ```bash
   giga harness list
   giga harness validate my-harness
   giga ui
   ```

For a starting template:

```bash
giga harness scaffold my-harness
```

## User-State Backup and Runtime Export

Before an upgrade or package rollback, stop every Cockpit process, durable
worker, and active run that owns the selected data directory. Create the
archive outside the Harness data directory and verify it before changing the
installed package:

```bash
giga state backup --output ../gpt2giga-harness-state.zip
giga state verify ../gpt2giga-harness-state.zip --json
# after stopping Harness, restore into an absent directory or confirm replacement
giga state restore ../gpt2giga-harness-state.zip --replace --json
```

The backup schema is versioned and content-addressed. Archive paths are
relative, ZIP metadata is deterministic, SQLite databases are copied through
consistent snapshots, and each retained file has a SHA-256 digest. Transient
lock, WAL, SHM, and temporary files are omitted. Creation fails closed on
symbolic links, unsupported file types, an existing destination, output inside
the state directory, or any source change observed during capture.

The archive is written atomically with mode `0600`, but it is not redacted: it
can contain opt-in captured content, attachments, and managed configuration.
Store it as private user state and do not attach it to an issue. Use the
content-free coordination export for support instead:

```bash
giga runtime export --output /tmp/harness-runtime.json

`giga state backup` covers the configured Harness user data directory
(`GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_DATA_DIR`, normally `~/.gpt2giga/harness`). Project-local
`.giga/` directories remain outside that archive and belong in the project's
own backup or version-control policy.

`giga state restore` verifies the archive again, rejects a runtime schema newer
than the installed Harness supports, stages retained modes and SQLite integrity
checks in a private sibling directory, and only then publishes the restored
directory. Restoring over an existing directory requires `--replace`; active
lock/WAL/SHM markers or a concurrent destination change fail before the swap.
An older runtime schema is upgraded only when the restored store is opened by
the installed package. Reverse migrations are not supported: package rollback
must restore the pre-upgrade archive created for that version. The command does
not touch project-local `.giga/` state.

## Migration from the Combined Prerelease

The previous branch-only combined prerelease exposed Harness modules below
`gpt2giga.harness`. The split release intentionally does not provide an import
shim. Update Python imports directly:

```python
# Before
from gpt2giga.harness.harnesses.base import BaseHarness

# After
from gpt2giga_harness.harnesses.base import BaseHarness
```

The historical plugin entry-point group remains supported as the
`gpt2giga.harnesses` compatibility alias. New adapters use
`agent_workbench.harness_adapters.v1`; entry-point targets and Python imports
continue to live under `gpt2giga_harness.*` until a separately gated namespace
migration.

Remove the old combined wheel before installing the split packages so stale
`gpt2giga/harness` files cannot mask a migration error:

```bash
python -m pip uninstall -y gpt2giga gpt2giga-harness
python -m pip install 'gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1'
```

For `uv` tool installations, recreate both tool environments:

```bash
uv tool uninstall gpt2giga
uv tool uninstall gpt2giga-harness
uv tool install --prerelease allow gpt2giga
uv tool install 'gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1'
```

The current `gpt2giga-harness==0.5.0a1` metadata keeps
`gpt2giga==0.2.5a1` in the explicit `gpt2giga` optional extra.

This package migration does not move or rewrite Harness state. Existing
`~/.gpt2giga/harness` data and project-local `.giga/` directories remain in
place. Do not delete them as part of uninstall/reinstall.

## Troubleshooting

Start with:

```bash
giga doctor .
giga doctor . --json
```

Common checks:

- proxy is reachable at `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_PROXY_URL` or
  `http://127.0.0.1:8090`;
- if relying on auto-start, `giga doctor` reports `Proxy / Auto-start: ready`;
- `GPT2GIGA_API_KEY` or `GPT2GIGA_HARNESS_API_KEY` matches the proxy when API-key
  auth is enabled;
- `GIGACHAT_CREDENTIALS` is present for real upstream calls;
- the selected mode uses the intended explicit route: `/v1/chat/completions` or
  `/v2/chat/completions`;
- external CLI harnesses report `missing` until the matching executable is on
  `PATH` or configured in `~/.gpt2giga/harness/config.toml`; invalid configured
  paths and startup errors from broken CLI installations are reported by
  `giga harness inspect <id>` and the run result;
- real external CLI harness runs perform proxy preflight before launching the
  CLI, so proxy auto-start errors are reported directly instead of being buried
  in agent stdout/stderr.
- native history sync and import commands share the browser UI's native index;
  use `giga native sync --include-external --json` when debugging why a native
  ref is not visible in the UI.
- if a managed native session cannot be resumed, inspect the session bundle's
  `native_links` metadata for `resume_reason`.

## Current Limitations

The alpha runs direct Chat Completions plus Codex, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI
through capability-proven structured, terminal, or one-shot paths. External
agent behavior still depends on the installed CLI's reviewed version window,
structured protocol flags, custom local API endpoints, native resume, and local
history formats. Claude embedded structured execution remains blocked; its
provider-owned handoff is not durable continuity. Use `--dry-run --json` for
direct compatibility commands and `giga harness inspect <id> --json` before
selecting a structured or terminal transport on a new workstation.

Attachment support is intentionally conservative. Document and binary transport
through external CLIs is path/reference based unless local CLI behavior has been
verified. Structured/one-shot events and native terminal output use separate
persisted SSE contracts; native terminals retain bounded polling as a
compatibility fallback. Harnesses or plugins that do not emit structured deltas
still appear atomically when their run completes.
