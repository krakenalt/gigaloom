# AGENTS.md — tests

## Scope

The root pytest configuration collects the standalone Harness, compatibility,
integration, smoke, script, and packaging contracts. Do not infer coverage
from an old directory inventory.

## Test design

- Add the smallest regression test that fails for the bug or missing behavior,
  then implement the fix.
- Test at the owning layer: pure transformations and policy as unit tests,
  mounted behavior through FastAPI clients, persistence through temporary
  stores, and packaging through built/installed artifacts.
- Mock GigaChat and other external services by default. Only `tests/live/` may
  call real upstream services, and those tests must remain explicit opt-in.
- Pytest asyncio auto mode is enabled. Do not add
  `@pytest.mark.asyncio` unless a test needs explicit plugin options.
- Use `create_app()` plus an explicit temporary Harness configuration for
  app-wide behavior. Avoid ambient env and singleton state.
- Use `tmp_path`, isolated Git repositories, temporary homes, and a temporary
  Harness data dir. Never read or mutate real `.giga/`,
  `~/.gigaloom`, or native agent state.
- Assert redaction whenever request bodies, tool arguments, credentials,
  environment values, stored events, previews, or provenance are involved.
- Change golden fixtures only for an intentional client-visible wire contract;
  review the human-readable diff.
- Keep package-boundary tests strict: Harness base artifacts must not install
  the optional gateway and must include their commands, entry points,
  dependencies, and no-build UI assets.
- Files/Batches modules exist without public aggregator mounts; tests must not
  assume that importing a router makes its API public.
- Admin, debug, replay, and metrics route tests must explicitly enable the
  corresponding settings instead of relying on ambient defaults.
- Markers are selective, not exhaustive. Do not use `pytest -m unit` as a
  substitute for the relevant path or full suite.

## Validation

During iteration, run the narrowest relevant pytest node with
`uv run pytest ... -q -n 0` when xdist worker startup would dominate the test.
Directory and full-suite runs inherit local `-n auto`; GitHub Actions overrides
it with the workflow's explicit `-n 4`.

Harness-focused gate:

```bash
./scripts/ci-base.sh pytest tests/harness -q
```

Full pytest/coverage gate:

```bash
./scripts/ci-base.sh pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=80
```

Run the full gate after shared fixtures/config, app composition, public protocol,
durable Harness state, package metadata, or cross-package contracts change.
